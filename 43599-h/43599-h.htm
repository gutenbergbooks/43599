<p class="stl1">The Birth of Owlglass, and how he was thrice
baptized.</p>


<div class="figleft">
<img src="images/ill-i2.jpg" width="72" height="76" alt="I" title="I" />
</div>

<p class="cap"><span class="upper">In</span> the Duchy of Brunswick is a forest called
Seib, and in this lies the village of Kneitlingen,
where the good child Owlglass
was born.</p>

<p>The life of this child does not confirm the old
saying, &ldquo;like father like son,&rdquo; for his father, by
name Elaus Owlglass, was a quiet respectable man,
and his mother, Anna, was the very model of a
woman, for she was meek and a woman of few
words. No particular circumstance attending the
birth of our hero is handed down to us, and it therefore
was, probably, not very different to other births;
but it is recorded that he enjoyed the benefit of three
distinct Baptisms.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span></p>

<p>There does not seem to have been any Church in
the village where he was born, for when the time
came for him to be christened he was sent by his
parents to the village of Amptlen, where he received
the name of Tyll Owlglass. The place is still remembered
as the scene of this ceremony; but also because
close by there stood once a castle of the same name,
destroyed, as a nest of robbers, by the good people
of Magdeburgh, with the help of their neighbours.</p>

<p>At the time we are speaking of it was the custom
of the land that the godfathers and godmothers,
together with the nurse and child, should adjourn,
immediately after the christening, to an alehouse,
there to enjoy themselves; and that part of the ceremony
was not forgotten or neglected on this occasion.
Now it was a long way from the Church to
the ale-house, and the day was very hot, so that the
party indulged rather freely in the refreshing beverage,
delaying their homeward journey as long as
possible.</p>

<p>At length, however, they had to get on their way;
and the nurse, whose head was rather giddy and legs
not over-steady, had very unpleasant visions of a narrow<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a><br /><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
footpath with ground sloping down into a muddy
ditch, and she had serious forebodings of how that part
of the journey would be accomplished. The nearer
she drew to the dreaded spot the more her nervousness
increased, and young Tyll, whether that she
clutched him more firmly to her, or whether he too
had forebodings of danger, began to kick and struggle
in her arms, so that her stopping on the brink of
danger, to gather steadiness and courage, was of no
manner of use, for just as one foot rested on a loose
stone a violent plunge of the child threw her fairly
off her legs, and threw himself over her head into
the ditch below. But weeds are not easily extirpated;
so no harm happened to the child excepting
that he was covered with mud and slime. Then he
was taken home and washed.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/ill03.jpg" width="396" height="522" alt="" />
<br /><span class="caption">Owlglass&rsquo;s Second Baptism.</span>
</div>

<p>Thus Owlglass was, on one and the same day,
thrice baptized. First, in all proper order and due
form, then in the muddy ditch, and lastly, in warm
water to cleanse him from the dirt. This was symbolic
of the many mishaps of his future life, for evil
is sure to fall back upon its perpetrator.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span></p>

<p class="stl2">How all the People of the Village, both Men and Women,
made complaints of young Owlglass; and how, whilst
on horseback with his Father, without his knowledge,
he made game of them all.</p>


<div class="figleft">
<img src="images/ill-o2.jpg" width="72" height="76" alt="O" title="O" />
</div>

<p class="cap"><span class="upper">Our</span> young acquaintance, Tyll, began at an
early age to show signs of a decidedly
marked character. He was full of life
and spirits, as the other children of the
village found out to their cost, for no sooner could
he crawl amongst them than he played all manner
of tricks. In truth he was more like a monkey than
the child of respectable Christian parents, and when
he had reached the age of four years he became daily
more mischievous. He played his companions as
many tricks daily as he was inches high, and, as &ldquo;ill
weeds grow apace,&rdquo; he soon became almost unbearable;
but yet they could not do without him, so quick
was his invention at all games, which, however, he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
so contrived that they were sure to end in a quarrel,
taking care to get out of it himself before the blows
came; and he would afterwards mock and laugh at
those who had got hurt. He was even more dangerous
away than with them, for he was then most
certainly planning mischief. He would find out
holes in the ground, which he carefully covered with
sticks and grass, and then foremost in the race to a
mark he had set up a little beyond the hole, he would
stop short, in time to watch the others tumble one
over the other into the trap he had set them.</p>

<p>Neither were the girls spared. Unknown to them
he would fasten their petticoats together with thorns,
as they sat on the ground, and then frighten them,
so as to make them jump up suddenly, when he did
not fail to point out the rents in their dresses, and
laugh at them for the scolding and beating they
would get at home. A hundred different tricks he
played them, so that every day some were sure to be
sent home crying and complaining.</p>

<p>True, he got many a thrashing from boys bigger
and stronger than himself; but so sure was he to
repay them tenfold, in one way or another, that both<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a><br /><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
big and small were afraid of him. Nor were the
parents spared when he could safely do mischief to
man or woman, so that constant complaints were
made to his father, to whom, however, he knew
how to defend and excuse himself so artfully that
the good simple man thought his dear child shamefully
ill-used.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/ill04.jpg" width="394" height="520" alt="" />
<br /><span class="caption">Young Owlglass mocking the Villagers.</span>
</div>

<p>Tired, at length, of these daily complaints, his
father determined to take him out with him when
he knew the street would be full, in order to show
the people how well and soberly his boy could behave;
so, taking him behind him on his horse, having
first impressed upon him that he must be very good,
they started off together. Now what did this obedient
child do? He put his finger up to his nose,
and by various other insulting gestures mocked the
people as they passed, till there was a general outcry
against the mischievous little imp. His father was
sorely puzzled; and Tyll, pretending to cry, said to
him, &ldquo;You hear, dear Father, what the people say.

Young hopeful, now seated before his father, could
do nothing but make faces and put out his tongue at

The poor man, who could see no fault in his darling,
said, &ldquo;Do not fret, my own dear Boy. We will go
and live somewhere else, and get away from these evil-minded
people.&rdquo; He did, indeed, move to a distance,
and not many years after died, leaving wife and child
in great poverty. Now young Tyll, though sixteen
years old, had learnt no business, nor anything useful
or good, but with years had increased in all malice
and mischief.</p>

<p class="stl2">How Owlglass crept into a Beehive; and how, when two
Thieves came in the night to steal it, he managed to
set them quarrelling, so that they came to blows and
left the Hive behind them.</p>


<div class="figleft">
<img src="images/ill-w1.jpg" width="72" height="76" alt="W" title="W" />
</div>

<p class="cap"><span class="upper">We</span> pass over a few years of Owlglass&rsquo;s life
during which he continued to thrive in
body, but we are sorry to say gave no signs
of moral improvement. However, in the
adventure we are about to relate, he was not so much
to blame, the sufferers being scarcely better than himself,
and in no way deserving of our sympathy.</p>

<p>He went one day, with his mother, to a feast in a
neighbouring village, where, having eaten and drunk
as much as he could bear for the time, he looked
about him for a convenient place to sleep. He found
some beehives, four of which were empty, and creeping
into one of these he thought he would have an
hour&rsquo;s quiet rest, but slept from mid-day to mid-night,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
so that his mother thought he had gone back
home. Now in that night two thieves came to steal
one of the beehives, and having heard that the heaviest
was always the best, they tried the weight of each;
and finding that one the heaviest in which Owlglass
was, they settled between them that that was the one
they would take, and walked off with it. The night
was as dark as pitch, so that there was no seeing at
all; but Owlglass was awake, and had heard them
consulting with each other. The motion was not unpleasant
as they carried him along; but yet he thought
he could do better than sleep, and after short consideration
he stretched out one hand, and with his finger
first slightly touched the neck of the man before him,
then he touched his nose, chin, cheeks, and forehead.
At each touch of the finger the thief thought one of
the bees had settled on him, till he fancied his face
covered with them, and dreaded every moment to
feel their sting. He dared not speak nor move a
muscle of his face, but trembled with fear till the
perspiration streamed down him. At length, however,
scarcely moving his jaws, he ventured to mutter
to his companion, &ldquo;I say, Jack,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;have you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
anything on your face?&rdquo; &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; growled his companion,
who was not in the best of humours, for he
began to find the hive heavy, &ldquo;I have a nose on my
face, and pray what have you to say against it?&rdquo; &ldquo;It is
not that I mean,&rdquo; said the first speaker; &ldquo;but have
you ever heard that bees swarm in the dark, for I am
covered with them?&rdquo; &ldquo;You are a fool,&rdquo; was Jack&rsquo;s
only reply. After a minute Owlglass again put out his
hand; and this time gave the front man a sharp tug
by the hair, who, thinking his companion had done
it, began to complain and swear. The other cried,
&ldquo;How is it possible I could pull your hair? Do I not
want both my hands to carry this abominable hive?
You must be mad or drunk; but let us have no more
of your nonsense, or it will be the worse for you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Owlglass laughed in his sleeve, enjoying this fine
sport; and, after they had gone on a little further, he
caught hold of the fellow&rsquo;s hair at the back, giving
his head such a pull forward that he scraped his nose
against the hive. The fellow&rsquo;s rage now knew no
bounds. &ldquo;You scoundrel,&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;first you say I
pull your hair and now you pull mine; but wait, you
shall catch it.&rdquo; Whereupon he let go of the hive, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a><br /><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
the other doing the like, they fell upon each other,
and a furious fight began. At length they both came
to the ground, and, rolling one over the other down a
steep bank, they became separated, and in the great
darkness neither knew where to find the other nor
the beehive.</p>

<p class="stl1">How Owlglass ate a roasted Fowl off the spit, and did
only half Work.</p>


<div class="figleft">
<img src="images/ill-t2.jpg" width="71" height="76" alt="T" title="T" />
</div>

<p class="cap"><span class="upper">The</span> first village Owlglass came to he went
straight to the Priest&rsquo;s house. Here he
was hired, the Priest telling him that he
should live as well as he and his cook, and
do only half the work.</p>

<p>Owlglass agreed, promising himself to the very
letter to act up to what had been said. The cook,
who had but one eye, put two chickens to the fire
to roast, bidding him turn the spit. This he readily
did, thinking all the while of the Priest&rsquo;s words,
that he should live as well as he and his cook; and,
when the chickens were well roasted, took one of
them off the spit, and ate it then and there.</p>

<p>When dinner-time had come the cook went to the
fire to baste the chickens, and seeing only one, said
to Owlglass, &ldquo;What has become of the other fowl?&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
To this he answered, &ldquo;Open your other eye, my good
Woman, and you will see the two.&rdquo; She flew into a
passion at having her defect of the loss of one eye
thus thrown in her teeth, and straightway went to
her master, to whom she complained of the insult
offered to her, and how that his new servant understood
cooking so well that two chickens dwindled
down into one. The Priest thereupon went into
the kitchen, and said, &ldquo;Why is it, Owlglass, that you
have mocked my servant? I see that there is only
one fowl on the spit, whereas there were two; what
has become of the other?&rdquo; Owlglass answered,
&ldquo;Open both your eyes, and you will see that the
other fowl is on the spit. I only said the same to
your cook, when she grew angry.&rdquo; The Priest
laughed, and said, &ldquo;My cook cannot open both eyes
since she has only one.&rdquo; Owlglass replied, &ldquo;That
you say, I do not say so.&rdquo; The Priest continued,
&ldquo;With all this, there is but one fowl.&rdquo; Owlglass
said, &ldquo;The other I have eaten, for you said I should
live as well as you and your cook, and therefore one
chicken was for me, and the other for you two. I
should have been grieved that what you said were not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a><br /><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
true, and thus I took my share beforehand.&rdquo; &ldquo;Well,
well, my good Fellow,&rdquo; his master said, &ldquo;it matters
little about the eaten fowl, only you do in future
what my cook tells you.&rdquo; Owlglass said, &ldquo;Yes, my
dear Master, as you told me so will I do.&rdquo; Now,
at the hiring, the Priest had said Owlglass should
do half the work which the cook would tell him,
so that he only did the half of what she told him to do.</p>

<p>When told to fetch a pail full of water, he brought
it only half full, and when he was to put two logs of
wood on the fire, he only put one on. The cook
saw well enough that all this was done to vex her,
and said to her master that if he kept such a perverse
fellow in his house she would leave it. Owlglass
defended himself, saying, it was quite natural that
having only one eye she should see the work only
half done. At this the Priest laughed; but to appease
his cook was obliged to dismiss his man, promising,
however, that he would be a friend to him.</p>

<div class="figleft">
<img src="images/ill-o2.jpg" width="72" height="76" alt="O" title="O" />
</div>

<p class="cap"><span class="upper">Owlglass</span> had played so many pranks in
the Duchy of Luneburgh that he was forbidden
the land, the Duke giving orders
that if found there he should be hanged.
Nevertheless, he continued to pass through the Duchy
whenever his road led that way; but one day, as he
was riding along devoid of care, he saw the Duke
himself coming with several followers. Then he
said to himself, &ldquo;If I fly I shall be pursued and cut
down, and, if I remain as I am, the Duke will come
up in great anger and have me hanged on the nearest
tree;&rdquo; and most provokingly one stood close by. There
was not much time for consideration, and none to be
lost, so, jumping off his horse, he killed the animal,
and, ripping it open, took his stand in its inside. Now
when the Duke came up to him he was astonished<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
at his impudence, and still more so at his extraordinary
position. &ldquo;Did I not promise you,&rdquo; he said,
&ldquo;that, if found in my territory, you should be surely
hanged? What have you to say for yourself?&rdquo; Owlglass
answered, &ldquo;I put my trust in your Grace&rsquo;s
goodness, and that you will not carry your threat
into execution, seeing that I have not done anything
to deserve hanging.&rdquo; &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said the Duke, &ldquo;let
me hear what you have to say in your defence, or
rather, tell me why you are standing inside your
horse?&rdquo; Owlglass answered, &ldquo;I sorely feared your
Grace&rsquo;s displeasure, and thought I had better be
found in my own property, where I ought to be
safe.&rdquo; The Duke laughed, and said, &ldquo;As long as
you remain where you are you shall be safe,&rdquo; and
then rode away.</p>

<p>Owlglass made the best of his way over the frontier;
but it was not long before he had occasion again
to be in the Duchy of Luneburgh, and hearing that
the Duke was coming to the neighbourhood where
he was, he straightway got a cart and horse, and going
up to a peasant, whom he saw digging in a field, he
asked whose land it was. The peasant said it was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a><br /><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
his own, for he had lately inherited it. Hereupon
Owlglass asked for how much he would sell him his
cart full of earth. They agreed for a shilling; and
Owlglass paying the money, filled his cart with earth,
in which he buried himself up to his arm-pits, and
drove leisurely on his way.</p>

<p>It was not long before he met the Duke, who,
seeing him sitting thus in the cart, stopped, and, with
difficulty restraining his laughter, said, &ldquo;Owlglass,
have I not forbidden you my land on pain of death?&rdquo;
To this Owlglass answered, &ldquo;I am not in your
Grace&rsquo;s land, but sitting in my own, which I purchased
from a peasant whose inheritance it was.&rdquo;
The Duke replied, &ldquo;Though sitting in your own
land, your cart and horse are on mine; but this once
more I will let you go in safety; beware, however,
that you do not come again, for then nothing shall
save you.&rdquo; Owlglass then immediately sprang upon
his horse and rode off, leaving the cart behind.</p>

<p class="stl2">Of the Manner in which Owlglass paints a Picture for
the Count of Hessen, and how he persuades him that
those of base birth could not see the Painting.</p>


<div class="figleft">
<img src="images/ill-a2.jpg" width="70" height="74" alt="A" title="A" />
</div>

<p class="cap"><span class="upper">After</span> Owlglass had wandered all over
Saxony, and was so well known that his
trickery and scheming were no longer of
any avail, he went to Hessen to the Count&rsquo;s
court. The Count asked him what he could do, to
which he answered, &ldquo;Noble Sir, I am a painter such
as is not to be found far and wide, for my work far
surpasses all other.&rdquo; The Count then said, &ldquo;Let me
see some of your work.&rdquo; Whereupon Owlglass produced
some curiously painted cloth which he had
bought in Flanders. The Count was well pleased,
and said, &ldquo;What must I pay you to paint the walls
of the grand saloon, representing the origin of the
Counts of Hessen, and how they have held on in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
friendship and enmity with the kings of Hungary,
and other princes up to the present time?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Owlglass said for that he must have two hundred
pounds; which the Count agreed to pay if he did
the work well. Owlglass stipulated for one hundred
pounds to be paid in advance, that he might buy
colours and hire assistants, and also that no one but
his assistants should enter the saloon during the progress
of the work, so that he might not be hindered.
All being agreed to, he hired three assistants, with
whom he settled that they were not to do any
work; but he nevertheless paid them their wages, and
they employed themselves mostly playing at cards
and dice. A month passed by, and then the Count
desired to know what progress had been made with
the work, and also to be allowed to enter the saloon.
Owlglass now said, &ldquo;Noble Sir, there is one thing
I must tell you, namely, that the base born cannot
see my work.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/ill08.jpg" width="392" height="519" alt="" />
<br /><span class="caption">Owlglass shows his Picture to the Count.</span>
</div>

<p>The Count was rejoiced on hearing this, thinking
how he could prove the birth of all by whom he
was surrounded, for he was mightily proud. They
then entered the saloon; and Owlglass partly drawing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a><br /><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
back a cloth, which he had stretched across the
side of the room he was supposed to be painting, said,
pointing at the same time with his mahlstick, which
he held in his hand, &ldquo;Here you behold the first Count
of Hessen, in whose noble bearing I trust you recognize
the great founder of your noble house; by his
side you see his wife, daughter of Justinian, afterwards
Emperor of Bavaria: they had issue Adolphus, from
whom descended, in a direct line, William the Brave,
Lewis the Good, and so on up to your own noble
self. You will not fail to appreciate how skilfully
I have brought into my composition each worthy
personage, occupied in a manner best suited to his
character. The drawing I know is faultless, and I
hope you admire the richness of the colours.&rdquo; Now
the Count said nothing to all this, and he said to
himself, &ldquo;Can it be possible that I am base born, for
I see nothing but the white wall?&rdquo; However, for the
sake of his own honour, he expressed himself well
pleased, adding that his want of knowledge of art
prevented his doing full justice to the great talent
displayed; whereupon he left the room. As soon as
the Countess saw him she anxiously inquired how he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
liked the painting, for she had her doubts of Owlglass,
who appeared to her a rogue. The Count
said he was well satisfied; and on her expressing a
wish to see it, said she might, with the painter&rsquo;s
permission. She immediately sent for Owlglass, and
requested permission to see his work. Owlglass
answered that he should be most happy to have her
opinion of what he considered his masterpiece, telling
her, as he had told the Count, the peculiarity
about his work, that it was invisible to the base born.</p>

<p>The Countess went to the saloon with eight attendants,
one of whom, a distant relation of her own,
was rather weak-minded. Owlglass drew back the
cloth, as he had done before, and explained his painting
in the same words as to the Count. The Countess
stared at the wall and then at him, and at the wall
again, but did not make one single observation. The
attendants were equally mute, excepting the weak-minded
one, who looked at the wall and her companions
in astonishment, and then exclaimed, that
base born or not, she could see nothing but a white
wall, and was convinced there was no more painting
on it than on the back of her hand.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span></p>

<p>The Countess went straight to her husband, and
told him that she was as well satisfied as he had been;
but that her weak-minded relative maintained that
there was no painting whatever on the wall, and
that Owlglass was an impostor who was making
fools of the whole Court.</p>

<p>The Count was vexed at this, and scarcely knew
what to think; but determined to see whether any
one else would make similar observations, he sent
word to Owlglass to have everything ready on the
following day to receive a visit from himself and his
whole Court. On receiving this message Owlglass
immediately dismissed his assistants, and went to the
treasurer and begged to be paid the hundred pounds
that were still due to him. He got the money without
difficulty, and the following day was no longer
at the Court, nor anywhere in Hessen.</p>

<div class="figleft">
<img src="images/ill-h.jpg" width="69" height="76" alt="H" title="H" />
</div>

<p class="cap"><span class="upper">Having</span> had such signal success in the arts,
Owlglass determined to try science and
letters; and therefore, when he came to
Prague, in Bohemia, he had notices stuck
up, on the church and college doors, stating that he
could solve the most difficult questions. His answers,
here, puzzled the learned more than they had puzzled
him with their questions; and thus made bolder in
impudence, he went to Erfurt, where he gave out
that he could teach any animal to read and write.</p>

<p>Now, at Erfurt there was a celebrated university,
and all the learned doctors met together and discussed
what they should propose to Owlglass, so that they
might disgrace him, and come off with greater honor,
themselves, than their brethren of Prague. As
soon as they had come to a satisfactory conclusion,
they had Owlglass called before them, and the head<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
of the university said that they had determined to put
a donkey to school with him, if he would undertake
to teach it to read. Owlglass agreed to do this without
hesitation, adding that, as a donkey was naturally a
dull animal, they must allow him a reasonable time
and a sufficient sum for the support of his scholar
during the course of his instruction. After conferring
among themselves, the learned doctors proposed
that twenty years should be allowed for the accomplishment
of the task, together with a sum of money
which Owlglass thought sufficient; and having received
part of the money in advance, he led his scholar
off to a stall he had constructed on purpose for him.
He felt no difficulty in his position, for he would be
freed from all responsibility by the death of his pupil,
which, at any time, could be brought about, but for
the time being determined to have some sport. He
took an old book, which he laid in the donkey&rsquo;s crib,
having strewed some oats between the leaves, and
when the animal found this out, it turned the leaves
over with its tongue to get at the oats. Now, when
it no longer found any it cried out, &ldquo;E-aw! E-aw!&rdquo;
which Owlglass noticing, at once went to the head<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a><br /><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
of the university and said, &ldquo;Learned Doctor, would
you not like to see how my pupil is getting on?&rdquo;
&ldquo;Does he improve?&rdquo; the Doctor asked; to which
Owlglass replied, &ldquo;He is naturally uncouth and difficult
to be taught, but by great care and perseverance
I have brought him on so far that he pronounces
some letters.&rdquo; Several of the dignitaries of the university
assembled at the donkey&rsquo;s stable, and as soon
as Owlglass placed a book before the poor creature,
which had been kept fasting all day, it eagerly turned
over the leaves, looking for the oats, and not finding
any, cried with a loud voice, &ldquo;E-aw! E-aw!&rdquo; &ldquo;You
hear, my worthy Sirs,&rdquo; Owlglass said, &ldquo;that he already
pronounces a vowel and a diphthong pretty distinctly,
and I have every hope that his progress will now be
more rapid.&rdquo; After this exhibition, Owlglass one
night fastened a notice up at the college door to the
effect that the donkey, his scholar, was now fully
competent to be at the head of the university, and
to instruct the other donkeys of Erfurt, whom he
therefore left to his charge. Owlglass that night
disappeared from the town, not forgetting to take
with him the money he had so deservedly earned.</p>

<p class="cap"><span class="upper">After</span> leaving Erfurt, Owlglass dressed
himself as a priest, and, travelling about
different parts, levied contributions wherever
he found ignorance and credulity, of
which there was no lack. He carried a death&rsquo;s head
about with him, which he pretended was the skull
of Saint Brandonis, possessing miraculous virtue for
the cure of all manner of illnesses. He also pretended
that he was collecting subscriptions for building
a church in honour of Saint Brandonis, and that
all who brought an offering would, by the intercession
of the Saint, find it restored to them a hundredfold
before the year was over. When he arrived at
any town or village he sought to find out any prevailing
vice or sin, and would then give out that,
from persons addicted to this particular vice or sin,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
he could not accept any offering for the Saint. By
these means the offerings flowed in more abundantly
than had ever been collected, for those who felt themselves
most guilty were most eager, by their offerings,
to prove their innocence. Thus Owlglass got his
pockets well filled and went to Nurenberg, where
he determined to rest for a time from his labours, and
enjoy himself as long as his money would last. After
being there some time, and knowing all the in&rsquo;s and
out&rsquo;s of the place, he grew tired of idleness, and
nothing could satisfy him but a piece of mischief.
During his wanderings he had noticed that, in the
evening, the town watchmen assembled together in
a cellar under the town-hall, and that to get from
the town-hall to the pig-market a small wooden
bridge had to be passed, which crossed the river called
the Pegnetz. Bearing all this in mind, he waited
one night till the whole town was quiet, then, after
breaking three planks of the bridge, he went up to
the town-hall and set up a furious bellowing and
shouting, at the same time striking the paved road
with an iron spiked stick till the sparks flew on all
sides. This roused the watch, and as he ran away,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a><br /><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
they chased him towards the pig-market. Owlglass
jumped over that part of the bridge where he had
broken the planks, and stopped on the other side,
shouting to his pursuers, &ldquo;O! O! you pig-headed
timber-toed rogues, is that the way you run? I see I
must needs wait for you!&rdquo; This enraged the men, and
all together they rushed on the bridge, which giving
way where he had broken the planks, they fell one
over the other into the Pegnitz. There he left them,
and turned his back upon the town of Nurenberg.</p>

had notices posted that he was a celebrated
dentist and doctor; that he could
not only cure the toothache without extracting
the tooth, but that the most inveterate disease
would immediately yield to his remedies.</p>

<p>He met with a wag who was willing to join him
in cheating the good people of Schomberg, afterwards

pain from toothache, but immediately that Owlglass

people, whereat they were greatly astonished, and
they crowded to him to be cured of every imaginable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
pain; but Owlglass appointed all to meet him on the
following day, at a stated time, for he was in treaty
to restore the patients of the hospital to health, and
that before that great work was accomplished, he
could not undertake any fresh case. The master of
the hospital, on hearing Owlglass&rsquo;s announcement
that he could cure all diseases, had applied to him,
for he had the hospital full of patients, and was most
anxious to be rid of as many as possible. He agreed
to pay fifty pounds, Owlglass engaging that the next
day the hospital should be free of patients.</p>

<p>Now this is the way he set about the serious task.
He went to the hospital and asked each patient separately
what ailed him or her, after which he said:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You must now solemnly swear that you will not
reveal to any living being what I am about to tell
you.&rdquo; And having received the required promise, he
continued:&mdash;&ldquo;The only way in which I can cure
you is by taking one of your number, and burning
him to powder, give a portion to each of the others.
Therefore, I shall take that one amongst you who
is most seriously affected, in order that the others
may be saved. Now to find out which is most hopelessly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a><br /><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
ill, I shall place the master of the hospital at
the door, who will cry with a loud voice, &lsquo;Let those
who are well come out;&rsquo; and then the one that remains
behind I shall burn to powder. Do not forget what
I now tell you, for I should be sorry to have you
sacrificed.&rdquo;</p>

<br /><span class="caption">Owlglass administers a Pill.</span>
</div>

<p>The following morning he said to the master:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;All the patients are now cured, the truth of which
you will find; for if you stand at the door and cry
out, &lsquo;Let all those who are well come forth,&rsquo; you shall
see that not one will remain behind.&rdquo; It happened,
indeed, as he said, and the hospital was left empty,
whereupon he received the promised fifty pounds,
besides many thanks. After this he received all who
sought relief, whatever their sufferings might be;
and giving each one of his bread pills, for which he
took a small sum, he promised a perfect cure in three
hours&rsquo; time.</p>

<p>Before this time had elapsed, however, Owlglass
left the town with his illgotten earnings.</p>

<p class="stl1">How Owlglass sells his Horse to a Jew, and on
what Terms.</p>


<div class="figleft">
<img src="images/ill-o1.jpg" width="71" height="75" alt="O" title="O" />
</div>

<p class="cap"><span class="upper">Owlglass</span> stopped one day at a roadside
inn, for he had ridden a long way, and
both he and his horse were tired. On
entering the kitchen, which served as travellers&rsquo;
room, he found a Jew and two or three countrymen,
who had watched him as he rode up, and
were joking about his and his horse&rsquo;s appearance.</p>

<p>As I said, he had ridden a long way, and his horse,
which was none of the handsomest, jaded and covered
with dust as it was, cut but a sorry appearance, his
own not being much better. The countrymen
thought themselves rather wags, and one said, turning
to Owlglass, &ldquo;That is a handsome animal of
yours.&rdquo; &ldquo;And it must be allowed,&rdquo; the other added,
&ldquo;that the gentleman sat the spirited creature well.
I should not have liked my sweetheart to see him as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
he came along.&rdquo; The Jew was glad to put in his
joke, too; and, when it appeared he could do so with
safety, said:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is the shentleman willing to part with his handsome
beast? For if so I shall be happy to deal with
him, as it would just suit a great nobleman, a particular
friend of mine, for whom I have been looking
out for a horse; but he is very particular, and up to
the present I have not been able to find one good
enough for him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The countrymen laughed boisterously at this sally
of the Jew&rsquo;s, but Owlglass, appearing to take it seriously,
answered:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My horse is, indeed, a splendid animal; but as I
intend to rest myself here for some days I shall not
need it, and am therefore willing to deal with you,
my good Friend. I have sworn, however, not to part
with it for any sum of money, however great, and I
cannot break my oath; but you can have the horse
for your friend, if you agree to my terms. These
are, that, after I shall have given you six stripes on
your bare back, the animal is yours.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Miserable as the creature was the Jew was ready<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a><br /><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>

<p>Whilst the Jew was stripping his shoulders Owlglass
said, &ldquo;These two gentlemen are witnesses that
the horse is not to be yours till I have given you six
stripes.&rdquo; The countrymen, anxious for the fun, said
they would be witnesses; and the Jew having bared
his back, Owlglass tied his hands to a staple in the
door-post, and clutching his whip firmly gave him
such a cut that the poor Jew danced again. At
the second stroke he fairly howled; and after giving
him a third Owlglass said, &ldquo;I see, my Friend, that you
are not able to complete the bargain now, so I will
keep my horse till some future time, when I shall
have paid you the remaining three stripes.&rdquo; The
countrymen were convulsed with laughter, and the
Jew had the worst of the bargain.</p>

<p class="stl1">How Owlglass sells an Old Hat for more than its
Weight in Gold.</p>


<div class="figleft">
<img src="images/ill-o1.jpg" width="71" height="75" alt="O" title="O" />
</div>

<p class="cap"><span class="upper">Owlglass</span> having determined to give
himself a few days&rsquo; rest, put up at an inn
where he had noticed that the landlady
was a very lively intelligent woman, for
he thought that if an opportunity for a good piece
of mischief occurred, she would be quite ready to
second him. He remarked that amongst the daily
visiters there were two particularly stupid who
just on that account thought themselves superior to
the rest, and gave themselves considerable airs.</p>

<p>Owlglass could not resist the temptation to play
these a trick; and, having taken the landlady into
his confidence, he invited them to sup with him.
He told them many curious stories and adventures;
and after he had prepared their minds to take in
anything, however wonderful, he took down his hat,
which was hanging against the wall, and which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
happened to be a very old one, saying, &ldquo;You will
scarcely believe that this hat is worth fifty times its
weight in gold; but the fact is, it has the extraordinary
power of making any one to whom I owe
money believe I have paid them, when I hold it in
a particular manner.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Fools as his guests were, this was more than they
could believe; but Owlglass engaged to give them
proof of it that very moment, and that they should
see the landlady would say she was paid. He rang
the bell, and when the landlady appeared, he asked
her how much he owed her for the supper, and she
said five shillings. Whereupon he continued, holding
his old hat in a peculiar manner, on the tips of
his fingers, &ldquo;Have I not paid you for the supper?&rdquo;
To which she answered, &ldquo;Yes;&rdquo; adding that she was
very much obliged to him.</p>

<p>At this they marvelled; and when he said he was
willing to sell it for fifty pounds, there was a dispute
between them which should buy it, when it was at
length agreed they should buy it between them.
When Owlglass received the money he made his
accomplice a handsome present and went on his way,
leaving the purchasers to try the virtue of the hat.</p>

<p class="stl2">How Owlglass, by means of a false Confession, cheated
the Priest of Riesenburgh out of his Horse; and how
he steals another Priest&rsquo;s Snuff-box.</p>


<div class="figleft">
<img src="images/ill-a1.jpg" width="71" height="76" alt="A" title="A" />
</div>

<p class="cap"><span class="upper">After</span> this adventure, Owlglass went
to Riesenburgh, where he lodged with
the Priest, whom he knew, having been
there several times before. This priest
had a very pretty maid-servant and a beautiful little
horse, which horse the Duke of Brunswick much
wished to have, and offered a considerable sum of
money for its possession; but though the offer was
often repeated the Priest as often refused, for he was
scarcely less fond of his horse than of his maid.
Owlglass having heard this, and soon after hearing
that the Duke was in the town, went to him, and said,
&ldquo;What will your Highness give me if I get you the
Priest&rsquo;s horse?&rdquo; &ldquo;If you can do that,&rdquo; the Duke
answered, &ldquo;I will give you the coat I now have on.&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
Now this coat was of scarlet velvet, ornamented with
pearls.</p>

<p>After this Owlglass pretended to be ill; and taking
to his bed, moaned and sighed so piteously that both
the Priest and his maid were much grieved, and knew
not what to do. As he daily seemed to grow worse,
the Priest admonished him to confess, as he had many
sins to answer for. Owlglass answered, that he was
anxious to confess himself, for though he did not
feel guilty of any grievous sin, yet there was one
which weighed heavily on his mind, but that he
could not confess to him, and therefore earnestly
begged he would fetch him another priest. When
the Priest heard this, there seemed something strange
in it, and his curiosity being strongly excited, he said,
&ldquo;Dear Owlglass, I should have to go a long way
for another confessor, and if in the meantime you
should die unabsolved we should both have much to
answer for, therefore speak, my Son, and your sin shall
be forgiven you.&rdquo; &ldquo;Be it so then,&rdquo; Owlglass said,
&ldquo;but my sin is not so great, as that I fear offending
you, for it concerns you.&rdquo; This excited the Priest&rsquo;s
curiosity still more, and he said, &ldquo;Speak without<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
hesitation, for I forgive you beforehand; besides, my
anger need not matter, for I dare not divulge your
confession.&rdquo; &ldquo;Oh, my dear, good Friend,&rdquo; Owlglass
answered, &ldquo;I know I shall much anger and
offend you; but since I feel that my end is near I
will no longer delay. I grieve to say that I have
kissed your maid more than once.&rdquo; The Priest inquired
how often that had happened; and being told
five times, he hastily absolved his penitent, and going
out called his servant to him. He accused her of
having allowed herself to be kissed by Owlglass; and
though she denied it, he took a stick and beat her
till she was black and blue. Owlglass laughed when
he heard the maid cry, and thought to himself, now
the business is settled; so after remaining in bed one
more day and night he got up, declaring himself to
be quite well. After settling with his host for his
board and lodging, he said, &ldquo;I am now going to
Halberstadt to the Bishop, to denounce you for having
divulged the secrets of the confessional.&rdquo; The poor
Priest, who a moment before had felt quite happy at
the prospect of getting rid of so dangerous a visiter,
was now taken quite aback, when he saw ruin staring<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a><br /><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
him in the face, and he begged most earnestly that
he would not betray him, for it was in anger. He
added that he would give him twenty pounds to purchase
his secrecy, but Owlglass declared that he would
not take fifty. Thereupon the Priest begged his
maid to intercede, and ascertain what Owlglass would
accept; and he, after making much difficulty, said
he would not take anything but the Priest&rsquo;s horse.
Now the Priest would rather have parted with anything
than his horse; but there was no help for it,
so he gave him the animal. Owlglass mounted the
horse and rode off to Wolfenbuttel, where he found
the Duke standing on the bridge. As he came near,
the Duke took off his coat, saying, &ldquo;You see, Owlglass,
that as you have performed your part of the
agreement I am ready to perform mine. There,
take the coat I promised you.&rdquo; Owlglass then had
to relate by what means he obtained the horse from
the Priest; at which the Duke laughed heartily, and
besides the coat gave him another horse.</p>

<p class="cap"><span class="upper">Whilst</span> staying in the house where the
adventure just told you occurred, he had
become acquainted with a priest who came
there several times, and there were two things he did
not fail to note. Firstly, this Priest was very heavy
with sleep every day after dinner, so that it seemed
impossible to him to keep his eyes open; and
secondly, he had a handsome silver snuff-box, which
it was his habit to lay down by his side after taking
a pinch from it. He lived in a town at no great
distance from Riesenburgh; and thither Owlglass
went to stay a day or two, the very first opportunity
he had.</p>

<p>Choosing the time when he knew the Priest had
dined, he went to the confessional, and by means of a
rambling story soon sent his friend asleep, his snuff-box
lying by his side as usual. Owlglass then put
the box in his own pocket, and having waked the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
Priest, said, &ldquo;There is one thing weighs very heavily
on my mind, for I have committed the mean crime
of theft, and I must beg of you to accept the stolen
article.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This the Priest refused to do, advising him to restore
it to its real owner; but Owlglass said, &ldquo;He
refuses to accept it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Under those circumstances keep it, my Son, and
I give you full absolution for having committed the
great sin of stealing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Owlglass then took the box out of his pocket,
saying, &ldquo;This is the box, and it was from you I stole
it; when urged by remorse I wished to make restoration,
but you refused to accept it, giving me full
absolution.&rdquo;</p>

<p>After this he left the confessional, and shortly after
the town.</p>

</div>

<p class="cap"><span class="upper">The</span> weather having turned wet, Owlglass
thought it well to have his boots greased,
that his feet might be kept dry during
his frequent wanderings; so, going to a
bootmaker of the name of Christopher, in the marketplace
of Brunswick, he gave him the boots, and said,
&ldquo;Let these be well larded, and have them ready by
to-morrow morning.&rdquo; When he had left the shop,
the bootmaker&rsquo;s foreman said, &ldquo;Master, that is Owlglass,
who plays every one some ugly trick or another,
so be very careful what you do, or your turn will
have come.&rdquo; The Master asked, &ldquo;What did he
tell us to do?&rdquo; &ldquo;He told you to lard his boots,
meaning to grease them,&rdquo; the Foreman answered;
&ldquo;and if I were you I would act up to the letter of
what he said; I should not grease them, but lard<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
them as one lards meat.&rdquo; &ldquo;Well, we will do as he
bids us,&rdquo; the Master said; and cutting up a piece of
bacon into small strips, he larded the boots as if they
were a joint of meat. Owlglass called the following
morning to ask whether the boots were ready; and
the bootmaker, pointing to them as they hung against
the wall, answered, &ldquo;Yes, there they are.&rdquo; Owlglass,
seeing his boots thus larded, burst out laughing,
and said, &ldquo;Now you are the sort of tradesman I like,
for you have conscientiously done as I ordered; how
much do I owe you?&rdquo; &ldquo;A shilling,&rdquo; was the answer.
As he paid the money, Owlglass said, &ldquo;You are
much too moderate in your charges, but I shall not
consider that with one miserable shilling I have paid
you. Rest assured, my good Friend, that I will not
forget you.&rdquo; Then taking his boots he departed,
the Master and his Foreman, looking after him, said,
&ldquo;He is the last man to whom such a thing should
have happened.&rdquo; And as they talked it over they
chuckled that the trickster, in his turn, had been
tricked. Their merriment, however, was of but short
duration, for suddenly Owlglass&rsquo;s head and shoulders
appeared through the shop window, the glass flying<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
in all directions about the place. &ldquo;Pray, my Friend,&rdquo;
he said, &ldquo;have the goodness to tell me whether
my boots are larded with sow&rsquo;s or boar&rsquo;s bacon.&rdquo;
When the bootmaker had recovered a little from his
surprise, he exclaimed, &ldquo;Get out of that, you
scoundrel, or you will have my last at your head.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Do not be angry, my good Sir,&rdquo; Owlglass said,
&ldquo;for I only wish to know what bacon that is with
which you have larded my boots; whether it is from
a boar or a sow?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The bootmaker&rsquo;s rage increased, and he abused
him in the vilest terms for breaking his window;
but Owlglass said coolly, &ldquo;If you will not tell me
what bacon it is, I must go and ask some one else;&rdquo;
and drawing back his head and shoulders, contriving
at the same time to break the windows still further,
he disappeared. Then the bootmaker was in a rage
with his man, and said, &ldquo;You gave me advice before;
now advise me what I am to do to make my
window whole again. Pack yourself off at once,
and the wages due to you I shall apply to repairing
the mischief your wisdom has caused.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="cap"><span class="upper">When</span> Owlglass found his pockets empty,
he hired himself to a Tailor, who said to
him, &ldquo;Sew neatly, so that no one can see
it, as a good workman should do.&rdquo; So
Owlglass took a needle and some pieces of cloth, and
having crept under the cutting board, with his face
turned to the wall, he laid the work across his knees
and began to sew in the dark. When the Master
beheld this proceeding, he said, &ldquo;What are you
doing there, my man? That is a most extraordinary
way of working.&rdquo; Owlglass answered, &ldquo;Master,
you told me to work so that no one could see it, and
as you yourself cannot see what I am doing, so can
no one else see my work, and therefore I am strictly
executing your orders.&rdquo; The Tailor, who was a quiet,
easy man, then said, &ldquo;That was not what I meant;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
come out there, and sew in such a manner that
every one may see how fine your work is.&rdquo; Thus
they went on for a matter of three days, when, one
evening, the Tailor, feeling sleepy, threw a half-finished
rough peasant&rsquo;s coat over to Owlglass, and
said, &ldquo;There, make up that wolf for me, and then
you can go to bed, as I am now going to do.&rdquo; You
must know, that that particular sort of coat was
called a wolf. As soon as the Tailor had left the
workshop, Owlglass cut up the coat, and with the
pieces first made the head, and then the body and
legs of a wolf. He stood it up by means of sticks,
and then went to bed. When, on the following
morning, the Master went into the shop, he started
back in a fright, but Owlglass just then coming in,
he saw how it was, and said, &ldquo;What have you been
doing here?&rdquo; Owlglass answered, &ldquo;I have made a
wolf, as you bid me.&rdquo; And the Tailor saying that he
did not mean a wolf of that sort, but the peasant&rsquo;s
rough coat, he continued, &ldquo;My dear Master, I wish
I had understood your meaning, for I would rather
have made a coat than a wolf.&rdquo; With this the
Master was satisfied, and they went on comfortably<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
together for three or four days more, when one evening
he again felt sleepy; but thinking it too early for
his man to go to bed, he gave him a coat which
was finished all but putting in the sleeves, and said,
&ldquo;Whip the sleeves to this coat, and then you can
go to rest.&rdquo; Owlglass hung the coat up on a hook,
and having laid the sleeves near it, he lighted two
candles, and, with a whip he then made, whipped
the sleeves all through the night. When the Tailor
came in, in the morning, he exclaimed, &ldquo;What tomfoolery
is this?&rdquo; &ldquo;It is no tomfoolery,&rdquo; Owlglass
answered, &ldquo;I have done as you told me; but though
I have stood here all night whipping the sleeves, I
could not get them to stick to the coat. It would
have been better you had let me go to bed than
make me waste my time in this way.&rdquo; &ldquo;It is not
my fault,&rdquo; the Tailor said, &ldquo;how could I know you
understood it this way, when I meant you to sew
the sleeves into the coat?&rdquo; Owlglass answered, &ldquo;I
wish you would not say one thing when you mean
another; but now you may do the work, for I must
go to bed.&rdquo; This the Tailor would no way agree
to, so they quarrelled; and Owlglass leaving him,
went his way.</p>

<p class="cap"><span class="upper">Owlglass</span> took a lodging at Bamberg,
near to the market-place, where he remained
about a fortnight, and next door
to him there lived a tailor who had three
workmen. These men sat on a board, supported
by four posts, outside the window, and they laughed
at Owlglass, and threw pieces of rag or cloth at him
whenever he passed. Owlglass bore all in silence,
biding his time to pay them back with interest; and
this he determined should be on a fair day, when
the market-place would be full of people. The
night before the day of the fair he had sawed the
posts nearly through which supported the board on
which the three tailors sat, and in the morning they
placed the board on them as usual, seated themselves<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
on it and began their sewing. Now, when the
swineherd blew his horn all the people let out their
pigs, and the tailor&rsquo;s pigs also came out of his house,
and went, as Owlglass well knew they would, under
the board, rubbing themselves against the posts,
which, giving way, the three journeymen tailors were
thrown into the gutter. Owlglass, who had been
on the watch, now cried out, &ldquo;See how light three
tailors are, for a gust of wind has blown them all at
once into the street, as if they were but three feathers!
How easily a tailor can fly!&rdquo; And this he cried so
loud that he could be heard all over the marketplace.
All the people came running to the spot to
see the fun, and mocked and laughed at the poor
tailors, who knew not what to do for very shame.
They could not tell how it was their board fell; but
they found out at last, and guessed that it was Owlglass
who had played them that trick. They put
up fresh posts, but did not again venture to make

</div>

<p class="cap"><span class="upper">Owlglass</span> now being in funds, he rode
about the country like a gentleman, and
one day came to a small town, where he
saw a very neat woman, with her servant
maid, standing at the door of a smithy, and judged
her to be the smith&rsquo;s wife. He put up at an inn just
opposite, and during the night pulled the four shoes
off his horse. On the following morning he led his
horse to the smithy; and as soon as it was known
that it was Owlglass, the wife and maidservant came
out to see what had brought him there. Owlglass
asked the Smith whether he would shoe his horse;
to which he at once agreed, for he was glad of an
opportunity to have some talk with a man of whom
he had heard so much. After much talk on both<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a><br /><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
sides, the Smith said, &ldquo;If you will tell me a truth
that is really true, I will put one shoe on your horse
without any charge.&rdquo; To this Owlglass answered,
&ldquo;If you have iron and coals, and there is plenty of
wind in the bellows, the fault will be yours if the
forge does not go on well.&rdquo; &ldquo;That is undoubtedly
true,&rdquo; said the Smith; and he gave him the promised
horseshoe. The assistant, as he was putting
on the shoe, said that if he would tell him a truth
that applied to him, he would put another shoe on
his horse. In answer, Owlglass said, &ldquo;A smith&rsquo;s
assistant must work hard and not spare himself if
he expects to please his master.&rdquo; &ldquo;That is true
enough,&rdquo; was the answer, and the horse had a second
shoe. Then the wife and the servant wanted a truth
told them, for which each promised his horse a shoe.
Owlglass whispered his answer in the ear of each
of these. To the mistress he said, &ldquo;When a servant
apes her mistress&rsquo;s dress, she would be mistress not
only in dress alone.&rdquo; The Mistress marked his
glances as well as his words, and said, &ldquo;That is true
enough;&rdquo; so there was a third shoe for the horse. And
to the maid he said, &ldquo;When a servant is better looking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
than her mistress, she will find it difficult to
please her in anything.&rdquo; The Maid said, &ldquo;That I
know to be true.&rdquo; So the horse got its fourth shoe,
and Owlglass rode further on his way.</p>

<p class="stl1">How Owlglass hired himself to a Merchant as Cook
and Coachman.</p>


<div class="figleft">
<img src="images/ill-i2.jpg" width="72" height="76" alt="I" title="I" />
</div>

<p class="cap"><span class="upper">In</span> the town of Windsheim there lived a
rich merchant, who was walking one
day outside the town, when he saw Owlglass
lying on the grass, and stopping, he
asked him what his calling was. Owlglass answered
that he was a cook; whereupon the Merchant said,
&ldquo;You are just the man I want, that is, if you understand
your business; for my wife is not at all satisfied
with her present cook, and we have some of the
first people of the town to dine with us to-morrow,
to whom we would like to give a good dinner.&rdquo;
Owlglass said that he would serve him faithfully,
and that he felt confident of giving satisfaction; so
the merchant engaged him, stipulating that he should
also serve as coachman, and took him home with him
at once. As soon as the merchant&rsquo;s wife saw Owlglass,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
she said, &ldquo;Who is this fellow whom you have
brought home with you, for I do not like the look of
him at all?&rdquo; Her husband answered, &ldquo;Never mind
his look, my Dear, for he is a first-rate cook, and we
will serve up a dinner to-morrow that shall be the
envy of the whole town.&rdquo; Early the next morning
the Merchant gave Owlglass full instructions as
to the dinner, telling him what soup, meat, and
vegetables to get, and how he liked everything done.
&ldquo;As for game,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;Professor Guzzle is particularly
fond of roast hare, so we cannot do better
than let him have his favourite puss; but, mind, let
it be the finest that can be got in the whole town.&rdquo;
Owlglass promised that all his instructions should
be strictly attended to; and the Merchant, having
business of importance to attend to, went out in easy
confidence in his new servant. The Merchant got
home only just in time to receive his guests, so that
he could not visit the kitchen before dinner, and his
wife was too fine a lady to attend to such matters.
However, the dinner went off very well, and the
hare, in particular, was declared to be the finest that
had been seen that year; so that all the company were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
in high spirits. At dessert the conversation turned
upon cats; and one of the ladies, addressing the mistress
of the house, said she had heard that she had
the finest one in the whole town. The Merchant&rsquo;s
wife was very proud of her cat, and gave orders that
it should be brought into the room; but it could not
be found anywhere; and now the servants remembered
that they had not seen it since the morning,
when one of them saw Owlglass carry it from the
kitchen to an outhouse. Owlglass was now sent
for into the dining-room, before all the guests, and
questioned as to what had become of the cat. Without
being in the slightest degree disconcerted, he said
his master had told him that Professor Guzzle was very
fond of roast hare, and that they could not do better
than let him have his favourite puss, and therefore he,
Owlglass, was to be sure and get the very finest in the
town; that he had searched the whole town through,
but there were none to compare to the one in the
house, and he was sure his master would not begrudge
it his guests; therefore he had killed and roasted it,
and the company had just eaten it. Horror was
depicted upon most of the countenances, whilst one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
or two of the guests tried to joke about it; but these
the very first showed symptoms of distress, and one
after another of the company had to leave the room
pale as death, and not one returned. The mistress
insisted upon Owlglass being at once sent away;
but the Merchant said, &ldquo;I want him to drive me
and the priest to Goslar to-morrow, and when we
get back I will immediately send him about his business.&rdquo;
That evening he told Owlglass to get the
carriage ready for the morrow, and to grease it well.
As soon as all had gone to bed, Owlglass took some
cart grease and greased the carriage outside and in,
but particularly the seats. Early the next morning
the Merchant ordered the horses to be put to the
carriage, and he and the priest getting in, they drove
off in high spirits. They had not gone far, however,
when they found they were gradually slipping off the
seats; and the Priest exclaimed, &ldquo;What is all this
grease? I held on with my hands to check the jolting,
and I am all grease.&rdquo; They ordered Owlglass
to stop, and they found they were covered with
grease; so that they had to buy a bundle of straw
from a farmer and rub themselves and the carriage<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
well. The Merchant had now lost all patience,
and he cried out to Owlglass, &ldquo;I find out now that
you are a professed wag, and of the most mischievous
class; but you are in the right road, go on, my good
Friend, straight to the gallows, and there your journey
will be at an end.&rdquo; Owlglass did as he was bid, for,
turning off the road, he drove straight to a gallows
which stood at no great distance, and stopping there
began to take the horses out of the carriage. &ldquo;What are
you doing now, you rascal?&rdquo; the Merchant exclaimed.
Owlglass answered, &ldquo;You told me to go straight to
the gallows, and that there my journey would be at an
end, so I naturally thought that we were to stop here.&rdquo;
The Merchant looked out of the carriage, and seeing
that they were indeed under the gallows, could not
help laughing. He said, &ldquo;You have delayed us
so long on the road with your foolery that I am
afraid we shall not reach Goslar in time for our
business, so now, my good Fellow, I pray you get
on as fast as you can. Do not look behind you, but
mind only the road before you.&rdquo; Owlglass now again
mounted his horse, having first loosened the pin connecting
the front wheels, and set off as fast as the horses<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a><br /><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
could gallop. He had not gone far when the pin fell
out; but, without looking behind him, he galloped on,
carrying off the pole and front wheels, and leaving the
body of the carriage far behind. In vain the Priest
and Merchant shouted to him to stop. On he went;
so they had to jump out of the carriage, and by scrambling
through hedges and running across fields they
were, fortunately, able to overtake him. Complaint
was useless; and as they found they could not now
reach Goslar in time, even if their coachman could
be trusted to take them there, they determined upon
returning home. The homeward journey was accomplished
without any further accident; and when
the Merchant found himself safe in his own house,
he called Owlglass to him and said, &ldquo;It is but too
evident that all the mischief you have done since you
have been with me has been done purposely. What
have you to say to this?&rdquo; Owlglass answered, &ldquo;I
do everything strictly to the letter, as I am told, and
if I do wrong, the fault is therefore not mine, but
the fault of those who give the orders. You do not
seem satisfied, so, if you pay me my wages, I would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
rather look for justice elsewhere.&rdquo; The Merchant
thinking it better to avoid further, and perhaps
worse, mischief by getting rid of him at once, paid
him, and they parted.</p>

<p class="stl1">How Owlglass cheated a Horse-dealer at Wismar, and
afterwards cheated the Public.</p>


<div class="figleft">
<img src="images/ill-o2.jpg" width="72" height="76" alt="O" title="O" />
</div>

<p class="cap"><span class="upper">Owlglass</span> next went to Wismar, a
town much frequented by horse-dealers,
and one of these had a habit of pulling
the tail of any horse he thought of buying.
This he did from a notion that, if the hair were
firm in the tail, the horse was strong, and would
live long; but if, on the contrary, the hair came out
freely, that the animal would not last long, and he
would therefore have nothing to do with it. Owlglass
knew of this habit, and determined to make
some profit of it, so he bought a horse without a tail,
which he got very cheap on that account, and most
artfully he fastened a beautifully flowing tail to the
bare stump, by means of blood and gum. With this
horse he went to Wismar, and asked so high a price
that no one would bid for it, until the dealer came<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
whose habit it was to pull the horses&rsquo; tails, and him
he asked a very low price. Before striking a bargain,
the Horse-dealer, as usual, caught hold of the
tail, and having formed a favourable opinion of the
animal, gave it, perhaps, a harder tug than customary,
when, lo and behold, the tail remained in his hands,
and he measured his length upon the ground. A
shout of laughter arose on all sides; but that was
not enough for Owlglass, who cried out, at the
highest pitch of his voice, &ldquo;See here! the villain has
ruined my horse, for, beautiful creature that it is,
who would have it without a tail?&rdquo; The people
drew nearer and took part with Owlglass, so that the
Horse-dealer had to pay him ten pounds for the
damage done to his horse, and Owlglass laughed
more heartily than any one, though only to himself.</p>

<p>He rode out of Wismar in high spirits, his trick
having succeeded so well; and as soon as he was outside
the town he fastened the tail on again, intending
to sell the horse in the next town. As he rode
along, however, he thought of some other way how
to make money by his horse, before finally parting
with it. In pursuance of the plan he had formed,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
he stopped at an inn two or three miles distant from
the town, where he intended to put his plan into execution.
Here he remained till it had grown dark,
so that he might enter the town unseen; which having
done, he hired a stable, and having put up his horse,
and attended to it himself, he locked the stable-door,
putting the key in his pocket.</p>

<p>The next morning he had it cried through the
town that there was a horse to be shown with its
tail where its head should be, stating a certain hour
at which only it could be seen. Before the appointed
time he made all necessary preparations in the stable,
when he again locked the door and then stood before
it, waiting the arrival of the curious. Now, as
curiosity was pretty general in the town, there was a
numerous attendance; and when Owlglass judged
that all the company to be expected had arrived,
he collected the admission price from each, and then
threw the door open.</p>

<p>There was a general rush, followed by laughter
from some, and indignant complaints from others,
as they saw the horse, no different in itself to other
horses, but fastened with its tail to the manger instead
of its head.</p>

</div>

<p class="cap"><span class="upper">We</span> next meet with Owlglass in a town
where he remained so long that he knew
all the secrets of the place. By turns he
took up his abode in twelve different inns,
so that what had escaped him in one he was sure
to hear in another, and it was little good he heard
in either. For a long while he puzzled his brain
what he could best do to suit the good people among
whom he had the honour of living, when, at length,
he hit upon a novel fancy, and, going into the market-place,
he began sowing, up and down, sideways
and crossways, the seed being represented by small
pebbles. The people came in crowds, and to their
questions what he was sowing, answered that he was
sowing rogues. The people cried out, &ldquo;Those are
not wanted here, for we have more than enough of
them; and, pray, why do you not sow honest men
as well?&rdquo; He answered, &ldquo;Those will not grow
here.&rdquo; These words were reported to the Town<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a><br /><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
Council, who had him called before them, and
ordered him to pick up his seed again, and then
leave the town. His seed he could not well pick
up; but he left the town, and after travelling about
ten miles, came to another. Here, however, the
report of his wonderful seed had reached before him,
so that he was not allowed to stop there, but had to
pass through as quickly as possible. There was no
help for it, so, escorted by the town authorities,
he went down to the side of a river, which flowed
through the town, and there hired a boat to carry
him and his seed. He jumped into the boat, but
when the boatman raised his bag to lift that in, it
burst and all the seed fell out. Owlglass pushed off
the boat, crying out to the astonished spectators that
he left them his seed, for he was sure that in such
a highly virtuous town a few rogues were required
to keep up a proper balance; and when he reached
the opposite side, leaving the boat to the mercy of
the stream, he ran on his way. Whether the seed
took root or not is not said; but to judge by the
quantity of rogues in the world, it would seem it
did, and that Owlglass sowed some of the same sort
in other parts of the world.</p>

<div class="figleft">

</div>

<p class="cap"><span class="upper">Once</span> upon a time Owlglass went to the
city of Hamburg, and having reached
the market-place he there stood still and
looked about him. Whilst he was standing
there a man came up to him and asked what he
was looking out for. Owlglass saw at once, by his
questioner&rsquo;s appearance, what business he followed,
answered that he was a barber and was seeking employment.
&ldquo;Well met then,&rdquo; his new acquaintance
said, &ldquo;for I just happen to be in want of a barber&rsquo;s
assistant, and I dare say we shall be able to come to
a satisfactory arrangement together. I live in that
high house just opposite. You see those windows that
reach down to the ground. Go in there, and I will
follow you presently.&rdquo; Owlglass answered, &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
Then crossing the road walked straight through the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
window, with a terrific crash, and made a polite bow
to those within the room. The barber&rsquo;s wife sat
there spinning, and, being much frightened, cried out
for help, saying, &ldquo;Here is a madman come through
the window.&rdquo; Owlglass said to her, &ldquo;My good
Lady, pray be not angry, for the master bid me come
in here, having just hired me as his assistant.&rdquo; &ldquo;May
the foul fiend take you,&rdquo; the lady answered, for she
was not possessed of the most even temper, &ldquo;a pretty
assistant you are. Was the door not wide enough
for you, that you must needs come in through the
window?&rdquo; Owlglass answered, &ldquo;My dear Madam,
must not an assistant do as his master bids him?&rdquo;
Just then the Barber entered, and seeing all the
destruction around him, exclaimed, &ldquo;What does all
this mean?&rdquo; Owlglass addressed him thus, &ldquo;You
said to me, you see those windows that reach down
to the ground&mdash;go in there, and I will follow you
presently. Now this good lady is angry that I have
broken the window, but how could I help doing so,
as it was not open? It seems to me that I have the
most reason to complain, for I might have cut myself
to pieces in doing what I was told to do; but I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a><br /><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
hope whatever may be the danger I shall never shrink
from doing my duty. Now, excuse me to the lady I
beseech you, my dear Master, for you see I could not
avoid causing the mischief that has happened.&rdquo;</p>

<br /><span class="caption">Owlglass walks through the Barber&rsquo;s Window.</span>
</div>

<p>The poor Barber knew not what to say, so thought
he might as well not say anything; besides, he wanted
his assistance, and was in hopes he might be induced
to accept more reasonable terms in consideration of
the damage he had done. He now gave Owlglass
some razors to sharpen, and as they were somewhat
rusty at the backs, he said, &ldquo;Brighten up the backs;
indeed, make them quite like the edge.&rdquo; Owlglass
took the razors and made the backs as sharp as the
edges, so that the Barber, when he went to see what
he was doing, exclaimed, &ldquo;This is not right!&rdquo;
&ldquo;How not right?&rdquo; Owlglass said; &ldquo;are the backs
not sharp enough? But have a little patience and
they shall be quite like the edges, as you told me to
make them. You see they had got very blunt at
the backs, but after a little more sharpening you will
be satisfied with them.&rdquo; &ldquo;Are you an idiot?&rdquo; the
Master cried in a rage; &ldquo;or is all this mischief done
intentionally? Leave the sharpening and pack yourself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
off back to where you came from.&rdquo; &ldquo;Well,&rdquo;
Owlglass said, &ldquo;I see we should not be happy together
for all our lives, so I may as well go at once;&rdquo; and
he walked out through the window as he had gone
in. The Barber was still more enraged at this, and
ran after him to have him seized and locked up till
he paid for the broken window; but Owlglass was
too quick for him, reached a ship that was just about
to sail, and was off.</p>

<p class="stl1">How Owlglass frightened an Innkeeper at Eisleben
with a dead Wolf.</p>


<div class="figleft">
<img src="images/ill-i1.jpg" width="72" height="76" alt="I" title="I" />
</div>

<p class="cap"><span class="upper">In</span> the depth of winter Owlglass put up at
an inn at Eisleben, where one evening
there also arrived three merchants from
Saxony on their way to Nurenberg. They
related how they had been attacked by a wolf, against
which they had much difficulty in defending themselves,
and that this disagreeable adventure had considerably
delayed them. The host, who was a bragging
sarcastic sort of a person, joked them much
about their adventure, declaring that it was a shame
they should allow themselves to be delayed by a
miserable wolf; that, for his part, if he were attacked
by two wolves, he would soon drive them off, but
here three were frightened by one wolf. This
continued all the evening till the merchants went to
bed, Owlglass in the mean time remaining silent,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
but turning it over in his mind how he could best
play mine host some trick to pay him off for his bragging.
The merchants and Owlglass shared the same
bed-room; and when the former discussed among
themselves how they could repay the mocking of the
Innkeeper, Owlglass said he had been thinking it
over, and that if they would leave it to him he would
engage that they should hear no more about the wolf.
The merchants readily agreed, promising a handsome
reward if he paid their tormentor off well; and Owlglass
then proposed that they should continue their
journey, and all meet again there on their return. Early
the next morning the merchants paid the reckoning
for Owlglass, as well as for themselves, and rode on
their way, mine host calling after them to beware
lest a wolf should cross their path. Owlglass also
took his departure and went on the chase after a wolf.
He succeeded in killing one, which he left out in
the cold till it was frozen quite stiff, and when the
merchants returned he put his prize in a sack, and,
taking it with him, joined them at the inn as agreed
upon. The Innkeeper again teased his guests about
the wolf, talking very big of how he would act. When<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
the merchants went to their bed-room Owlglass
joined them, and said, &ldquo;My good Friends, keep your
candle burning, and do not go to bed yet, for we will
have some sport this night.&rdquo; Now, as soon as all
the household had gone to bed, Owlglass fetched the
dead wolf, which was hard frozen, and taking it to
the kitchen placed it near the hearth, supporting it
with sticks so that it stood upright, at the same time
opening its jaws in which he put a child&rsquo;s shoe.
Then, quietly returning to his room, he called loudly
for something to drink. When the Innkeeper heard
this he grumbled at being disturbed, and calling up
the maid told her to get some beer for his guests.
The maid went to the fire in the kitchen to light a
candle, and seeing the wolf with its jaws wide open,
rushed out into the yard, thinking the brute had surely
devoured the children. Owlglass and the merchants
continued to call for drink, and the Innkeeper, thinking
the maid had gone to sleep again, called the man.
He went to the fire to light a candle, and when he
saw the wolf, thought it had made away with the
maid, so he too ran out into the yard. The shouting
for drink still continuing, the Innkeeper thought<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a><br /><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
the man must be asleep as well as the maid, and,
grumbling like a bear, he himself got up. As soon
as he had lighted a candle he saw the wolf with the
shoe in its jaws, and running to the merchant&rsquo;s room,
trembling with terror, cried out, &ldquo;Come and help
me, my dear Friends, for there is a frightful monster
in the kitchen, which has devoured my children,
maid, and man servant.&rdquo; They went with him;
the girl and the man came from the yard, and the
wife brought the children. All were alive. Owlglass
then went up to the wolf, which he turned over
with his foot, and it did not stir; then turning to the
Innkeeper, said, &ldquo;What an arrant coward you are!
It is not long ago that you said you were ready to
fight two wolves, and just now you ran away, trembling
and shouting, from a dead one.&rdquo; The Merchants
made rare fun of mine host, and the next
morning, after paying the bill, took their departure
with Owlglass.</p>

saved it from its tormentors; but this was beginning
to fail, when, fortunately, a man came that way.</p>

<p>This man had more kindness in his heart than
money in his pockets; but with this he had one
great fault, for he was somewhat restless and fickle-minded,
which, however, on this occasion proved
fortunate for the poor little mouse, and eventually
so for himself. His restless disposition had driven<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
him to travel, poor as he was, and thus he came to
the village, where witnessing the little creature&rsquo;s distress
he released it, by giving the boys a few half-pence,
and it instantly took refuge in a hole close by.</p>

<p>In his wanderings he came to another village where
he saw a crowd of boys, and, I am sorry to say, there
were girls as well, tormenting an inoffensive donkey,
which he saved from further molestation by again
parting with a little of his scanty stock of money.</p>

<p>Further on he reached another village, where he
released a bear from like persecution by giving more
money.</p>

<p>Not long after these adventures this good man
himself got into trouble, and was condemned by a
cruel judge to be put into a box with only a jug of
water and one loaf of bread, and thus thrown into
the river, though I assure you he was quite innocent.</p>

<p>You may imagine his distress, for he was not very
comfortable in his box, nor could he see where he
was being carried to, when all at once he felt the
box grating against the ground, and then heard a
nibbling at the lock, which, after awhile, gave way,
and when he raised the lid was delighted to see his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a><br /><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
three friends, the Mouse, the Ass, and the Bear, who
now helped him in return for his kindness to them.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/ill24.jpg" width="391" height="521" alt="" />
<br /><span class="caption">Friends in Grave Consultation.</span>
</div>

<p>They were not satisfied with merely saving his
life, for they knew that he was poor, and had, moreover,
spent some of his money to save them; so they
were consulting together what they could do for him,
when the bear espied a white stone come floating
along. &ldquo;Nothing could happen more fortunate,&rdquo;
the Bear cried, &ldquo;for here comes the lucky stone, and
whoever has that will have all his wishes fulfilled on
the instant.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The man, hearing this, seized the stone as it was
passing, and wished himself in a palace with every
comfort and luxury, surrounded by beautiful grounds;
and the next instant all was as he had wished. Now,
dazzled by so much splendour, and happy beyond
anything he had ever dreamt of, he forgot his friends,
the Mouse, the Ass, and the Bear, though, I have
no doubt, he would have thought of them sooner or
later and wished them with him; but before this
fault was remedied misfortune came upon him.</p>

<p>It so happened that some merchants passed that
way, and seeing a magnificent palace, where before<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
there had only been barren land, they were seized
with wonder and curiosity, so they went in and
asked the owner how he had worked such a truly
wonderful change. &ldquo;I had only to wish for it,&rdquo;
was the answer. They marvelled at this, as well
they might; and being told that it was by means of
the lucky stone his wish had been fulfilled, they
offered all their merchandize for the stone.</p>

<p>Our friend, whose head, it must be confessed, was
not as good as his heart, seeing so many beautiful
things, agreed to the bargain at once, without thinking
that he need only wish and he could have all
those and more beautiful things. He gave the merchants
the stone; and it was no sooner out of his
hands than he found himself in his former position,
which was rendered worse when he compared all
the splendour and comfort he had lost to his ugly
comfortless box, with only a jug of water and one
loaf.</p>

<p>His friends, however, did not desert him in his
distress, but this time they could not open the box;
and, after consulting, the Bear said, &ldquo;I see we cannot
do any good without the lucky stone, so let us<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
go to the palace where the merchants now live and
try to get it.&rdquo; This was agreed upon; and when they
got there they held another council. The bear seems
to have had the wisest head, for he was again spokesman,
and said, &ldquo;It is useless for us to expect to be
let in here; but you, my friend Mrs. Mouse, you can
creep through anywhere&mdash;see, there is just a little
hole at the bottom of the door. Go in, and, as only
one of the merchants is now at home, worry him in
every possible way, for you can always manage to
escape; and when you have worked him into a perfect
fury lead him here to the door, and no doubt he
will open it to rush out after you. Then we two
will go in and easily master him between us. Only
you take care to find out where he keeps the
stone.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The mouse got through the hole in the door without
difficulty; and, after finding out where the stone
was, went in search of the merchant, whom she
found in bed. She crept in at the bottom and began
nibbling at his toes. The merchant jumped up in a
fright, but when he saw the mouse his fright turned
to rage, and he made a snatch at it; but the little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a><br /><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
thing was too quick for him: and now began a chase
all round the bed-room, round every table and chair,
and into every corner of the next room, and, finally,
into the hall, where, jumping up and biting him in
the calf of the leg, in order to exasperate him still
more, she slipped through the hole she had got
in at.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/ill25.jpg" width="392" height="518" alt="" />
<br /><span class="caption">The Merchant&rsquo;s Rough Handling.</span>
</div>

<p>The merchant threw open the door, and the bear,
who was ready, greeted him with the closest embrace.
They rolled down together, but the bear
soon hugged all the breath out of him, and leaving
him in charge of the donkey went with the mouse
to fetch the stone. No sooner had they this in their
possession than the three went off, regardless of the
confusion they left behind them.</p>

<p>They soon reached the water-side; but the box
was floating in deep water, and the Donkey said, in
despair&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We shall never get at it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Bear, however, cried, &ldquo;Nonsense, leave that
to me, I can swim well enough, so you, Donkey,
just put your fore-feet round my neck, and take the
stone in your mouth, but mind you don&rsquo;t swallow it;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
and you, my little Friend, can make yourself snug
somewhere in my long hair.&rdquo;</p>

<p>All being satisfactorily arranged, off they set, but
were destined to meet with a misfortune on their
voyage; for the bear, who was rather fond of hearing
himself talk, could not refrain from expatiating
on the past adventure.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We managed that pretty well, I flatter myself.
What is your opinion, my long-eared Friend?&rdquo; And
as the donkey made no answer he continued&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How is this? I was always taught that a civil
question deserves a civil answer; but this does not
seem to enter into your notions of politeness. Who
taught you manners, my Friend?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The donkey could stand it no longer, but opened
his mouth, and out fell the stone &ldquo;plop&rdquo; into the
water.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There, you see what comes of your talking.
Could you not wait till our work was finished? How
could I open my mouth without losing the stone?
And now it is gone, and with it all hope of helping
our friend.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, well, my good Fellow,&rdquo; the Bear interrupted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
him, for he was not anxious to hear any more,
as he felt himself in the wrong, &ldquo;a moment&rsquo;s action
is better than an hour&rsquo;s regret. I have a bright idea
that will put all right again. Let us go back, and
I&rsquo;ll set about it at once.&rdquo;</p>

<p>On the way back the bear called up all the frogs
that were in those parts, and said to them, &ldquo;Fetch
me up as many stones as possible from the bottom of
the water, for I have an idea of building you a place
of refuge in case of danger.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A loud croaking was immediately heard, which
called the frogs from all parts; and they set about
collecting stones without loss of time.</p>

<p>It was not long before the lucky stone was added
to the heap, which the bear immediately seized; and
telling the frogs that there were now stones enough,
the three friends started off again.</p>

<p>They soon reached the box, which now opened
without difficulty, and the poor prisoner was relieved;
but only just in time, for the loaf of bread was consumed,
and he began to suffer from want.</p>

<p>As soon as he had the stone in his hand he wished
himself back in the palace, which he found just as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
he had left it. This time he did not forget his
friends, and they lived happily together to the end of
their days.</p>

<p>Now, does not this story prove that an act of kindness
meets with its reward, and that the ungrateful
are worse than the brute beasts, for our three good
animals effectually showed their gratitude?</p>

<h2><a name="XXIII" id="XXIII">XXIII.</a></h2>

<p class="stl1">Tim Jarvis.</p>


<div class="figleft">
<img src="images/ill-t3.jpg" width="71" height="76" alt="T" title="T" />
</div>

<p class="cap"><span class="upper">Tim</span> Jarvis was as decent and hardworking
a man as any one could wish to know, till
the evil spirit got astride his imagination.
Tim was not only a decent, hardworking
man, but recollected his early lessons, that the evil
one should be resisted with might and main.</p>

<p>Nor was it during the day that the enemy, at
first, attempted to gain any advantage; but it was at
night that he mainly worked upon his mind by
means of dreams.</p>

<p>Night after night he dreamed of treasures of gold
and precious stones that were to be found, first in
one place and then in another, till it grew too much
for him, and his waking hours were scarcely different
to dreaming. He was now found digging anywhere
but in his garden or potatoe field; and indeed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
his dreams led him all the way from Ireland to
London-bridge, with his spade across his shoulder.</p>

<p>Now, when poor Tim was on London-bridge he
felt himself more puzzled than ever he had been in
his life; he was quite bewildered by the confusion
and noise, and being pushed from one side to another;
but after a while he began to recover himself;
and as he walked up and down, first on one side and
then on the other, he tried the ground with his
spade, but quite accidentally like, or as if it were a
walking-stick, for he was wide awake.</p>

<p>&ldquo;For sure,&rdquo; he said to himself, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not going
to let so many people suspect what treasure is lying
under their feet.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He was encouraged by the hollowness of the
sound; but then again his spirits sank, for he found
no spot where his spade could make the slightest
impression, nay, he doubted whether he could stick
a pin in anywhere, so hard were the stones.</p>

<p>When it had grown dark, and the bridge was
still crowded, he began to fear that all the people
were there for the same purpose as himself; but he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
was determined that he would tire them out; and
indeed the numbers did gradually decrease.</p>

<p>St. Paul&rsquo;s had just struck twelve, when a stranger,
stopping just in front of our friend, said&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, Tim, you have come a long way, but you
might have done better nearer home. You know,
Tim, the lane that runs at the back of your cabin,
and you know the old wall, for I&rsquo;ve seen you digging
under that many a night. Well, Tim, you
were in the right road, but too near home. I&rsquo;ve
seen you turn sharp round that wall, and, crossing
the big bog, look longingly at the heap of stones
behind the furze-bush in Terry O&rsquo;Toole&rsquo;s field.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; sighed Tim; &ldquo;but it would have been
more than my life was worth to dig there, for though
Terry knows well that his whole field is nothing
but ugly stones, he would murther man, woman, or
child who stuck a spade in any part of the ground&mdash;the
big baste.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;True for you, Tim,&rdquo; the stranger said, &ldquo;but
the gold is there.&rdquo; After these words the stranger
was gone as suddenly as he had appeared, and poor
Tim was left, more puzzled than ever.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;May be,&rdquo; he said to himself, &ldquo;its desaiving me
he is, that he may have the digging of Lunnon-bridge
all to hisself, but then sorrow a spadeful of earth
could any one throw up here, in all his life. No,
it was to meet the sthrainger that I came all the way
here without knowing it, so now I&rsquo;ll go back to
ould Ireland.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tim did go back, and, after selling his potatoe-field,
bought the waste bit of land, which O&rsquo;Toole
was pleased to call a field.</p>

<p>What did Tim care, when all the neighbours
called him mad, or even when his wife threatened
him because he sold the bed from under her to buy
a new spade and pick, for he knew it was troublesome
ground he had to work in, and no mistake.</p>

<p>When night came, after he had all ready, Tim
went to his new property, and, hard as the work
was, did not rest till the first grey of morning began
to appear. Just then, through a crack in the ground,
he thought he heard voices below. He listened,
scarcely drawing his breath, when all the breath was
frightened out of him, for he plainly heard&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll give Tim a nice dance when he comes
for our gold.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span></p>

<p>When he had recovered himself a bit, he scrambled
out of the hole as fast as possible, and went
home, where he met with no over-pleasant reception
from his wife.</p>

<p>A strange day that was which Tim spent, divided
between rejoicing and trembling, for he knew now
for certain that gold was there; but he knew, too,
that there were some sort of beings to be dealt with;
and what were those beings? His hair stood on
end as he pictured some frightful monsters to himself;
but yet all must be risked to gain possession of
the gold, and he said, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s mighty polite I&rsquo;ll be to
the gintlemen, and sure they won&rsquo;t harm a poor
man.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Over and over again he repeated what he should
say to the &ldquo;gintlemen,&rdquo; and thus the day passed;
the most anxious day of his life. He took care to
arm himself with more than natural courage, in the
shape of a bottle of potheen, of which he took a
sup, and then another, and then a still longer one,
before he jumped into the hole.</p>

<p>In the darkness, for night had come on, he plainly
saw a light shining through the crack in the ground,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
as the night before, so he immediately set to work;
and he had not thrown up many spades of earth,
when the ground gave way, and he sank down, he
never knew how low, nor could he ever recollect
more than that he found himself surrounded by the
strangest little beings, who were all jabbering at
once, and seemed very angry.</p>

<p>He remembered that he made them his best of
bows, and gave them his fairest words, when the
tallest of them, stepping forward, addressed Tim
thus:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tim, we see that you are a decent, well-spoken,
and polite gentleman, and in your case we will overlook
our privacy being intruded on, which you must
look upon as a great favour.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And &rsquo;tis very much obleged that I am to your
honer and the other gintlemen, and sure &rsquo;tis I that
will never forget it; but might I not make so bold
as to tell you that I am a poor man, and ask your
honour whether you could not help me with a
thrifle?&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was a loud shout of laughter, and then the
same little fellow that had addressed him before,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
said, &ldquo;Well, Tim, we have plenty of the rubbish
you all think so much of. There, take as much of
the gold as you can carry.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tim saw that the ground was covered with guineas,
which he set to picking up as fast as he could
stow them away, and when he could not find room
for one more, he took both his hands full, sighing
that he must leave so many behind.</p>

<p>Then the little people cried out, &ldquo;Go home, Tim
Jarvis; but shut your eyes close, or some mischief
will happen to you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He did as he was told, and felt himself whisked
through the air quicker than lightning. Some time
after he knew that he no longer moved, he ventured
to open his eyes, for he felt a mighty tugging at his
hair. He found himself by the side of the hole he
had been digging, and his wife, who had grown
tired of his strange ways of late, was shaking him
rather roughly.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/ill26.jpg" width="394" height="520" alt="" />
<br /><span class="caption">Tim Jarvis and his Wife.</span>
</div>

<p>&ldquo;Lave the breath in me,&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;and I will
fill your apron with golden guineas.&rdquo; He put his
hand in his pocket, but only pulled out a few yellow
furze-blossoms. When he saw this Tim was quite<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a><br /><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
dejected, and did not venture to answer a word to
his wife&rsquo;s reproaches, but allowed himself to be led
home.</p>

<p>From that night he left off dreaming; and taking
again to his industrious, hardworking habits, soon
made up for his past neglect, and was not only able
to buy back his potatoe-field, but became a happy,
flourishing man.</p>

<p>His wife used to say that it was only a dream
about the little people and the gold, for that certainly
she had found him asleep; but Tim shook
his head.</p>

<p class="stl1">The Shoemaker and the Dwarfs.</p>


<div class="figleft">
<img src="images/ill-w2.jpg" width="67" height="72" alt="W" title="W" />
</div>

<p class="cap"><span class="upper">Why</span> do we read of so many shoemakers
that were poor? Surely they must have
lived in Ireland; but, be that as it may,
we have to tell of another, who, though
he was most anxious to fit all the world, could find
no customers, till at last he had nothing left but just
leather enough to make one pair of shoes.</p>

<p>He had been running about all day, longingly
looking at all the feet, and wishing he might measure
some one for this last pair of shoes, but he returned,
having only worn out his own. However, with all his
poverty, he had a light heart and a good wife, who
was always ready to cheer him; so he determined to
make up the shoes in the very best style, and, putting
them in his window, trust to a purchaser.</p>

<p>He cut them out, intending to begin his work
early the next morning, and went to bed, soon falling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
asleep. Imagine the good man&rsquo;s astonishment when,
on the following morning, he found the shoes already
made, and in such a manner that he could not take
his eyes off them.</p>

<p>He put them in his window, though he could
hardly make up his mind to part with them, and, half
hoping to frighten purchasers away, he set twice as
high a price upon them as it had been his custom
to charge.</p>

<p>However, a customer was soon found; and though
it was with regret he parted with those master-pieces
of work, yet, when he held so much money in his
hand, he was delighted, for not only could he buy
leather to make two pairs of shoes, but he could get
his wife a few necessaries she had been long obliged
to dispense with.</p>

<p>That evening he cut out two pairs of shoes, ready
for the next morning, when, on getting up, he found
those finished, with workmanship no less excellent
than that of the night before.</p>

<p>For these, also, customers were speedily found, at
equally good prices as the previous pair; and that
night the Shoemaker cut out four pairs of shoes,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
which he again found made to perfection the following
morning. Thus it went on, the work that
was prepared at night being finished by the morning,
so that our good friend soon became a flourishing
man; but he and his wife remained as simple in their
habits as of old, preferring to spend what they could
spare on their more needy neighbours.</p>

<p>Curiosity seems part of a woman&rsquo;s nature, and
the Shoemaker&rsquo;s wife certainly felt very curious to
see who their friends were that did the work so
beautifully; so she proposed to her husband that they
should hide themselves, and, leaving a candle burning,
watch for their nightly visitors.</p>

<p>They did so, and at midnight saw two Dwarfs
come in, who immediately set to at the work left
for them, stitching and hammering away so fast
that the Shoemaker felt quite bewildered by their
rapidity. Not one moment did they stop, but worked
on till all was finished, and disappeared long before
daylight.</p>

<p>Now, if the Shoemaker&rsquo;s wife was curious, she
was kind-hearted as well, and was much grieved to
see that such good, industrious little fellows should be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
so neglected by their families and friends, for they
had not a stitch of clothes on, when it was winter
too. Had they no wives or no sisters to look after
their comfort? And she proposed to make them a
decent suit of clothes each.</p>

<p>The good man was delighted at the proposal; so
she bought the stuff, and gave herself but little rest
till she had made them a coat, waistcoat, and a pair
of trowsers each, as near their shape and size as she
could guess.</p>

<p>As soon as finished, the clothes were left for them
instead of the customary work, and the shoemaker
and his wife again watched their coming.</p>

<p>About midnight they appeared; and when they
found the clothes in place of their usual work, they
stood for a moment irresolute, and then took up
each article, examining it on all sides. They then
began to try on the things, not without making
several mistakes, for one of the little fellows had
got his arms into the legs of the trowsers, whilst
the other was putting on the waistcoat over the coat.
But at length they were dressed; and having examined
each other, and then themselves, they were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a><br /><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
so delighted that they set to capering and dancing
about the room, and playing all manner of antics,
jumping over the chairs and tumbling over head and
heels, till at last they danced out of the room hand-in-hand.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

<br /><span class="caption">The Dwarfs&rsquo; Capers.</span>

continued to prosper, and became a rich man; he
and his wife being respected and loved by all who
knew them.</p>

<p class="cap"><span class="upper">There</span> was once a Farmer, a great miser,
and he had a servant as simple as he himself
was close, for he had served his master,
three years without being offered any
wages, or asking for any.</p>

<p>After the three years, however, the man thought
he would not work any longer without pay, so he
said to his master, &ldquo;I have worked for you diligently
and faithfully, and hope you will now give
me a fair reward for my services.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Knowing that his man was a great simpleton, the
farmer gave him three-pence, saying, &ldquo;I not only
reward you fairly, but splendidly&mdash;here is a penny
for each year; but, now that you are rich, do not
squander your money and get into idle habits.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span></p>

<p>The poor fellow thought that he was rich indeed,
so determined that he would not work and slave any
longer, but travel and enjoy himself.</p>

<p>With his fortune in his purse, and his purse safely
in his pocket, he set out; and as he was going along,
singing merrily, a little dwarf came up and asked
him why he was so merry.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why should I not be merry,&rdquo; he answered,
&ldquo;for I am rich and have nothing to do but to enjoy
myself? I have worked hard for three years, and
saved all my earnings.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And how much might they be?&rdquo; the little man
asked. When told that the amount was three-pence,
he said he was very poor, and begged hard for the
money. The Countryman did not make him ask
long, and cheerfully gave him his three-pence, when
the little fellow said&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You have a kind, generous heart, and shall not
suffer for your liberality. You shall have three
wishes, which shall be granted you&mdash;one for each
penny.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Countryman was highly rejoiced, and said,
&ldquo;Many thanks, my good Friend, for your offer; and,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
first of all, I would like to have a gun which will
bring down everything that I shoot at; and, secondly,
I choose a fiddle, to which, when I play, every one
must dance, whether he will or no. These will
satisfy me, so I will not trouble you with a third
wish at present.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your wishes are soon granted,&rdquo; said the Dwarf,
and gave him the desired gun and fiddle; after which
he went his way.</p>

<p>Our friend was happy before, but now his happiness
knew no bounds; and he only wanted an opportunity
to try his fiddle, for the gun he had already
tried several times as he walked along.</p>

<p>The desired opportunity was not long wanting,
for he soon met a Jew; and just where they met stood
a tree, on one of the branches of which sat a plump
wood-pigeon.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wish I had that bird,&rdquo; said the Jew; &ldquo;could
you not shoot it for me, my Friend?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is easily done,&rdquo; was the answer; and the
same instant the bird fell amongst some thorn-bushes
at the foot of the tree. The Jew crept in among
the bushes to pick it up; and no sooner was he in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
the middle than the Countryman took his fiddle and
played the sprightliest of jigs.</p>

<p>The first sound no sooner reached the Jew&rsquo;s ears
than he began to dance; and, as the tune went
on, he jumped and capered higher and higher, at
every leap he took leaving a piece of his clothes
hanging to the thorns. The thorns soon began to
enter his flesh, and, in pain, he cried out&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;For heaven&rsquo;s sake, leave off playing! What have
I done to deserve this?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What have you done?&rdquo; said the Countryman.
&ldquo;How many a poor wretch have you not ruined! And
the duty to avenge them has fallen upon me, so I
will just play you another tune, and mind you dance
well to it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Jew then offered him money to give over;
but, as his offer did not rise high enough, he had to
dance on till, in despair and worn out by fatigue and
pain, he said he would give a hundred pieces of
gold, which he had in his purse. As the purse was
thrown down the Countryman&rsquo;s heart was softened;
so he gave over playing, took up the purse and went
his way, highly delighted with his day&rsquo;s work.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/ill28.jpg" width="395" height="520" alt="" />
<br /><span class="caption">The Jew&rsquo;s Dance.</span>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span></p>

<p>No sooner had he gone than the Jew crept out
from among the thorns, half naked, and his heart full
of bitterness and revenge. The loss of his money
smarted even more intolerably than the wounds in
his flesh, and he hastened to the nearest judge, to
whom he complained how he had been robbed and
ill-treated, giving a description of his tormentor.</p>

<p>The judge could not refuse justice to the Jew; so
he sent out his officers, who soon caught the Countryman,
and, brought back, he was put upon his trial.</p>

<p>The Jew&rsquo;s evidence, and the sorry plight he was
in, were too convincing to be got over, though the
defence was that the money had been given of his
own account and not taken from him.</p>

<p>The Countryman was condemned to be hanged.
He was led off to the gallows at once; but just as the
rope was about to be put round his neck he said&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My Lord Judge, I cannot complain of the sentence
passed upon me, since my accuser swears that
I robbed and ill-treated him, and I only ask to have
one favour granted me before I die.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Anything excepting your life,&rdquo; was the answer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I do not ask my life, but only that you will order<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
my fiddle to be restored to me, and allow me to play
once more upon it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No! no! for heaven&rsquo;s sake, no!&rdquo; cried the Jew.
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t let him have that infernal fiddle, my Lord,
or misfortune will come upon the whole of us.&rdquo;
But the judge said his word had been given; so he
ordered the fiddle to be given to the prisoner.</p>

<p>The Countryman no sooner had the instrument in
his hands than he struck up a dance, and at the very
first note even the judge&rsquo;s feet began to shuffle
about as he sat in his chair, and as for the others
they fairly danced.</p>

<p>In vain the Jew caught hold of the clerk&rsquo;s desk,
for his legs flew out on either side; and as the height
of his capers was checked they only became the more
frequent.</p>

<p>The judge&rsquo;s clerk, the officers of the court, the
hangman, as well as all the spectators, were dancing
with all their might, and soon the judge himself
danced out of his chair into the midst of them.</p>

<p>At first all seemed good humour and enjoyment,
and no one, excepting the Jew, wished to check the
general merriment; but as it went on there were no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
bounds to the capers, and there were cries of pain,
as one alighted on another&rsquo;s toes, and cuffs and blows
were exchanged as one jostled the other.</p>

<p>The Jew, who had broken away from his hold
of the desk, was the maddest in his capers, and he
shrieked for mercy; the others soon joining in the
cry, begged the player to leave off, but he fiddled
away faster and faster till the judge promised him a
free pardon.</p>

<p>The Countryman said, &ldquo;I already once earned the
hundred pieces of gold, and I deserve them now
again for the dance I have played; so pray, my Lord,
order the money to be restored to me, or I must think
that you are not yet satisfied.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The judge then said the money should be given
him; but the Countryman, without leaving off playing,
addressed all the other dancers thus, &ldquo;You all
hear how handsomely his Lordship rewards me, and
I expect that each of you will show your gratitude,
for the amusement I have afforded you, by a present;
each according to his means.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So anxious were all to put an end to the dance that
every one offered what he could afford, but the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
Countryman said, &ldquo;I did not hear the Jew&rsquo;s voice.
Now, of him I have to request a full confession of
how he came by the hundred pieces of gold; and till
he has made this confession I must trouble you all
to continue the dance.&rdquo;</p>

<p>All threatened the Jew with instant death if he
did not confess; so the rogue was forced to condemn
himself by confessing that he stole the hundred
pieces of gold; for which he was punished with as
many stripes, when the dance was over.</p>

<p class="stl1">My Watch.</p>

<div class="figleft">
<img src="images/ill-i1.jpg" width="72" height="76" alt="I" title="I" />
</div>

<p class="cap"><span class="upper">I must</span> tell you my story myself, that is
the story of my watch, and bad luck to
it, for it was small comfort to me; and
what have I now left of it, but to tell the
trouble it brought upon me?</p>

<p>One day of the year eighteen hundred and thirty-three,
Tim Looney, the parish schoolmaster, a
mighty learned man, from whom I got my learning,
went up to Dublin, to get his lease renewed with
&rsquo;Squire Beamish, who is now dead and gone, rest his
soul. Well, as I was saying, Tim Looney went up
to Dublin, and had just come back, when of course
all the neighbours came to hear the news from the
big city, and Molly Mahone, as you can imagine,
thrust herself before them all, saying&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come, you auld pictur card, when are you goin&rsquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
to tell us the news? What is the good of you, you
auld worm, if you canna even speak?&rdquo;</p>

<p>You know Moll is rather hasty.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Och, and it&rsquo;s more wonders I have to tell than
one of you will believe. I saw the great Boneparte
riding on a flea, and the Dook of Wellington by his
side, quite friendly like.&rdquo; &ldquo;And was Boneparte a
very big man?&rdquo; said I.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; said Tim; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve heard say he
was a little man, but they call him the great Boneparte
for all that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He was a great man,&rdquo; said Moll to me, &ldquo;just
as you are a great fool, so hauld yer tongue, will ye,
and let Tim go on.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tim did go on, and told us many other great
wonders; but it&rsquo;s of myself I want to speak. Well,
then, after Tim had told us all he had seen, he gave
me such a fine large silver watch, and a thirty shilling
note, which my sister, Biddy, had sent from
Merica, for me to buy a new fiddle with, for she
had heard that I was great in music. I put the
watch in my pocket to keep it safe, and then I examined
the note all over, thinking all the while how<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
beautiful I would play on my new fiddle; but Tim
soon stopped me by asking me what o&rsquo;clock it was.</p>

<p>After looking at the sun, which he himself had
taught me, I told him it must be about two; when
he said, &ldquo;And why can&rsquo;t you look at the watch,
and tell me the exact minute it is?&rdquo;</p>

<p>I didn&rsquo;t look at my watch, for I thought it was
making game of me he was, but I said, &ldquo;And how
should she tell me the time of day? Can she speak?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are a big fool, Paul,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;look at
her face, and see where her hands point to.&rdquo; That
she should be able to tell me the time, and have a
face and hands, with which she points, was too
much, so I burst out laughing, but I took her out
of my pocket.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There,&rdquo; Tim said, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t you see something
sticking out on her face? Those are her hands, and
you see they point to numbers; but may be it&rsquo;s your
numbers you don&rsquo;t know, after all my teaching.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This provoked me, so I looked at what he called
her face, and saw the numbers, sure enough, and the
things he called the hands too. &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; Tim went
on, &ldquo;and what number does the short hand point<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
to?&rdquo; &ldquo;None,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;for it points just half way
between the two and the three.&rdquo; &ldquo;Then the long
hand points to six, and it&rsquo;s half-past two it is,&rdquo; Tim
said. &ldquo;And how does all this happen?&rdquo; I asked,
for I was sorely puzzled, Tim knowing too where
the long hand pointed, without my telling him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Put her up to your ear,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and she will
tell you how she works.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I did as I was told, and heard her go &ldquo;tick-a-tick,
tick-a-tick.&rdquo; As I listened to her a mighty
fear came over me, and I flung her from me, crying
out, &ldquo;The crittur does talk some unnatural language,
and perhaps she&rsquo;ll bite too.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tim caught her, and exclaimed, &ldquo;What a fool
you are, Paul!&rdquo; for he was now quite angry; &ldquo;if I
had not caught her she would have been done for
entirely.&rdquo; After he had held her some time in his
hands, seeing there was no harm in her, I took her
again and went home. I was half afraid of her, so
did not look at her again till night, when the big
varmint, Pat Molloy, came in, shouting fit to frighten
the life out of one.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is it a watch I hear you&rsquo;ve got, Paul?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Those ugly long ears of yours heard right,&rdquo; I
answered, for I did not much like Pat. &ldquo;And may
be then you&rsquo;ll be after telling one the time it is.&rdquo; With
that I pulled out the watch, and looked at her; but
I had clean forgotten what Tim had told me, though
I recollected something about her hands pointing to
a number, so seeing something pointing to seven, I
said at once, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s near seven o&rsquo;clock,&rdquo; for I did not
like to be looking too long, to be laughed at by that
fellow.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And it&rsquo;s near seven, it is,&rdquo; Pat said. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re
a fine fellow to have a watch. It&rsquo;s a turnip you
might as well have in your pocket, for it&rsquo;s long past
eight, it is.&rdquo; The pride of the O&rsquo;Moors and of
the O&rsquo;Doughertys was taken out of me entirely
quite by that rascal, for I felt it rush from the soles
of my feet into my head, but I wouldn&rsquo;t get into a
passion, for him to see that I was in the wrong, so
I said, &ldquo;And if you know the time so well, why
do you ask me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Pat only burst into a hoarse laugh, and ran out of
the cabin to tell every one, he could show his ugly
face to. I went to bed to drown my troubles, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
it was one long night-mare I had; first the watch
and then the fiddle dancing on my chest, grinning
at me all the while, with Pat Molloy looking on.</p>

<p>My first thought on waking in the morning was
my watch, and looking up to her, for I had hung
her on a nail, as I had been told, I said, &ldquo;Good
morning to you, how are you this morning, my
dear?&rdquo; for I thought it best to be civil to her, but
no answer did she make me. I spoke to her again,
and as she was still silent I took her down from the
nail and held her to my ear.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Och, it&rsquo;s dead she is,&rdquo; I cried, as she still gave
no signs of life, and I rushed across to Tim&rsquo;s. I
knocked at his window, shouting, &ldquo;Are you awake?&rdquo;
&ldquo;No,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;why should I be awake at this
time o&rsquo;morning?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;you must listen to me in your
sleep, for it&rsquo;s dead she is, and what will I do at all?&rdquo;
&ldquo;I hope she had the benefit of the Clergy,&rdquo; Tim
cried, starting up and coming to the window. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
not that I mean, it&rsquo;s not my mother at all, it&rsquo;s the
watch that&rsquo;s dead,&rdquo; I explained.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Leave me in peace then,&rdquo; he said, going back to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
his bed; but as I would not leave him in peace, but
kept crying out, &ldquo;What will I do?&rdquo; he growled,
&ldquo;Wind her up, you fool; she&rsquo;s not dead at all; but
give her here, and the key, or it&rsquo;s ruin her you will.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So I gave him the watch and the barn-door key,
which I happened to have in my pocket. It was
well for me that I turned my head on one side, as I
thought I heard some one coming, for just then the
key came whizzing past my ear.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wish it had broken your lubberly head,&rdquo; Tim
cried, in the biggest rage I ever saw him. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
the little key I want; the one with the bit of red
tape I gave you yesterday.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I fortunately found the funny little thing in my
pocket, but it was not a bit like a key. As soon as I
gave it him he twisted and twirled it about in her,
till I heard her cry, and then he said&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There, take her away, for she is all right again,
and mind you don&rsquo;t let me see you for a whole week,
or surely it&rsquo;s murder you I will.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Now, mind this and you&rsquo;ll see how strangely things
come about. If it had not been for this what Tim
said, I should not have had to tell you the story of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a><br /><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
my watch, or it would not have ended as it now
must. If Tim had told me about winding her up
the night before I should not have disturbed him in
the morning, and he would not have been so angry,
and would not have told me not to see him again for
a week. He has since said that he did not mean a
word of that; and, had I but known it, that tarnation
Pat could not have cheated me; however I will tell
you how it happened.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/ill29.jpg" width="392" height="523" alt="" />
<br /><span class="caption">The Death of the Watch.</span>
</div>

<p>Directly after I left Tim, whom should I meet
but Pat, who spoke quite civil, saying, &ldquo;Well, Paul,
and how&rsquo;s the watch? I&rsquo;ve been thinking since I heard
her &lsquo;glucking&rsquo; last night that it&rsquo;s to lay she wants,
and that if she had a nest you&rsquo;d have some young
watches in a day or two.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you think so?&rdquo; said I.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure of it,&rdquo; said he; so we went along to the
barn together and made her a nice comfortable nest
of hay.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; he said, as he laid her in it, and covered
her up quite warm and snug, &ldquo;you must not go near
or disturb her for five days, or it&rsquo;s desert her nest
she will, and you&rsquo;ll have no younguns.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span></p>

<p>Well, to finish with my story, after five days I
went to the nest, and what do you think I found?
No younguns, nor the old watch neither, but a big
turnip. I ran to Pat&rsquo;s, but he had gone off to America.
I never saw my watch again; but up to this
day the boys call out, when they are out of my
reach&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Paul, tell us what o&rsquo;clock it is.&rdquo;</p>

</div>

<p class="cap"><span class="upper">There</span> was a good woman of Kittleroopit,
but where Kittleroopit is exactly I cannot
tell you; so it&rsquo;s of no use pretending to
more than one knows. Her husband was
a vagabondizing sort of a body, and he went to a fair
one day, from which he not only never returned, but
never was anything more heard of him.</p>

<p>Some said that he enlisted, and others that he had
fallen into the hands of the press-gang; certain it is,
anyhow, that the press-gang was about the country
ready to snap up anyone, for our good dame&rsquo;s eldest
brother, Sandy, was all but smothered in the meal-tub,
hiding from these man-stealers; and after they
had gone he was pulled out from the meal wheezing
and sneezing, and was as white as any ghost. His
mother had to pick the meal out of his mouth with
the handle of a spoon.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span></p>

<p>Well, when her husband was gone the good woman
of Kittleroopit had little left but her baby, and there
was not much of that; for it was only a wee thing
of a few weeks old. Everybody said they were sorry
for her, but no one helped her, which is a case of
constant occurrence, as you know. The good woman,
however, had still something left, which was a sow;
and it was, moreover, near littering time.</p>

<p>But we all know that fortune is uncertain; for
one day, when the dame went into the sty to fill the
trough, what should she find but the sow lying on
her back groaning and grunting, and ready to give
up the ghost.</p>

<p>This was a blow to the poor woman, so she sat
down with the child on her knee and fretted more
sorely than ever she had done for the loss of her
husband.</p>

<p>I must tell you that the cottage of Kittleroopit
was built on the slope of a hill, with a small fir-wood
behind it; and as the good woman happened to look
down the hill she saw an old woman coming up the
footpath, dressed almost like a lady. She had on a
green dress, and wore a black velvet hood and steeple-crowned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
hat. She carried a staff in her hand as long
as herself&mdash;the sort of staff that old men and old
women used to help themselves along with long ago.
They seem to be out of fashion now.</p>

<p>Well, when the good woman saw the green lady
near her she rose up and began courtesying, and said,
&ldquo;Madam, I am one of the most misfortunate women
alive, for I have lost&mdash;&rdquo; But the green woman interrupted
her, saying&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t wish to hear piper&rsquo;s news and fiddler&rsquo;s
tales, my good woman. I know that you have lost
the good man of the house, but that is no such great
loss; and I know that your sow is very ill, which is
worse; but that can be remedied. Now, what will
you give me if I cure your sow?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Anything your good Ladyship likes,&rdquo; answered
the good Woman, for she little knew whom she had
to deal with.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s shake hands on that bargain,&rdquo; said the
green Lady; so they shook hands, and madam then
marched into the sty.</p>

<p>She looked peeringly at the sow, and then began
to mutter something which the good woman could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
not well understand, but she said it sounded like&mdash;</p>

<div class="centered"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0a">&ldquo;Pitter patter,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Holy water.&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p class="noi">Then she took a little bottle out of her pocket, with
something like oil in it, and rubbed the sow about
the snout and on the tip of the tail. &ldquo;Get up, beast,&rdquo;
said the green woman; and no sooner said than done,
for up jumps the sow with a grunt and goes off to
the trough for her breakfast.</p>

<p>The good woman of Kittleroopit was now as happy
as need be, and would have kissed the very hem of
the green madam&rsquo;s gown-tail, but she wouldn&rsquo;t let her,
and said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not fond of any such nonsense; but
now that I have set your sick beast on its legs again
let us settle our agreement. You&rsquo;ll not find me over
unreasonable. I like to do a good turn for a small
reward. Now all I ask, and will have, is the baby
at your breast!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The good woman of Kittleroopit, who now knew
her customer, gave a scream like a screech-owl, and
falls to begging and praying, but it wouldn&rsquo;t do.
&ldquo;You may spare yourself all this trouble and screeching
as if I were as deaf as a door-post; but this I&rsquo;ll<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
tell you, by our laws I cannot take your child till
the third day from this day, and not then if you can
tell me my right name.&rdquo; Hereupon the green lady
goes her way, round the back of the pig-sty, and the
good woman fell down in a swoon where she stood.</p>

<p>That night she could not sleep for fretting, and
the next day she could do nothing but hug her baby,
that she nearly squeezed the breath out of it; but
the second day she thought a walk would do her
good, so she went into the fir-wood I told you of.
She walked on far among the trees, with her baby
in her arms, till she came to an old quarry hole all
over-grown with grass. Before she came close up
to it she heard the &ldquo;bizzing&rdquo; of a spinning-wheel
and a voice singing, so she crept quietly among the
bushes and peeped down into the hole.</p>

<p>What should she see, but the green Fairy spinning
away as fast as possible and singing awhile&mdash;</p>

<div class="centered"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0a">&ldquo;Little knows the good old dame<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That Fittletetot is my name.&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, ha!&rdquo; laughed our good Woman, and she
was fit to jump for joy, when she thought how the
green old Fairy would be cheated.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/ill30.jpg" width="390" height="522" alt="" />
<br /><span class="caption">The good Woman discovering the Fairy.</span>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span></p>

<p>She was a merry woman when there was nothing
to weigh too heavily on her heart, so she determined
to have some sport with the Fairy when she came
the next day, as she little doubted she would. That
night she slept well, and found herself laughing in
the morning when she woke.</p>

<p>When she saw the green Fairy coming up the
hill, neither lazy nor lame this time, she put the
baby under her stool on which she sat so as to hide
it, and turning one leg over the other she put her
elbow on her knee, resting her head in her hand as
if she were fretting.</p>

<p>Up came the old Fairy, and said, &ldquo;You know
what I have come for, so let us waste no time.&rdquo; The
good woman pretends to grieve more than ever, and
wringing her hands as she fell on her knees, &ldquo;Good,
kind Madam,&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;spare my only child, and
take the old sow.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The foul fiend take the sow,&rdquo; the Fairy said;
&ldquo;I came not here for swine flesh. Now don&rsquo;t be
troublesome, but give me the child at once.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh! my good Lady,&rdquo; the good Woman again
said, &ldquo;leave my dear child and take myself.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;What does the old jade mean?&rdquo; the Fairy cried,
this time in a passion. &ldquo;Why, you old fool, who do
you think would have anything to do with the like
of you, you ugly old cat?&rdquo;</p>

<p>This, I promise you, put the good dame&rsquo;s back up;
for though she had blear eyes, and a long red nose,
she thought herself no less engaging than the vainest;
so up she jumped, and making a courtesy down
to the ground, she said&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We cannot all be as beautiful as your own sweet
self, and I might have known that I should not be
thought fit to tie even the shoes of the high and
mighty Princess Fittletetot.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The old Fairy could not have jumped higher if
she had been blown up; but down she came again,
and roaring with rage ran down the hill, followed by
the laughter of the good dame of Kittleroopit.</p>

<p class="stl1">The wee Bannock.</p>


<div class="figleft">
<img src="images/ill-t2.jpg" width="71" height="76" alt="T" title="T" />
</div>

<p class="cap"><span class="upper">There</span> was an old man who had an old
wife, and they lived by the side of a hill.
They had two cows, five hens and a cock,
a cat and two kittens. The old man
looked after the cows whilst the old woman knitted
stockings for him, and when she let her ball of yarn
fall the kittens sprang upon it, and after it as it rolled
away, till it got twisted round all the legs of the
chairs and of the table, so that the old woman had
plenty to do without knitting the stockings.</p>

<p>One day, after breakfast, she thought she would
have a bannock, so she made two oatmeal bannocks
and put them to the fire to bake. After a while the
old man came in and sat down by the side of the fire,
and when he saw the bannocks he took up one and
snapped it through the middle. No sooner did the
other see this than off it ran as fast as it could, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
the old woman after it; but the wee bannock ran
away and out of sight, and ran till it came to a pretty
large thatched house, into which it ran boldly up to
the fire-side. There were three tailors sitting on a
table, and when they saw the wee bannock come in
they jumped up and off the table, and ran behind
the good wife who was carding tow on the other side
of the fire.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Be not afraid,&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s only a wee bannock.
Catch it, and I&rsquo;ll give you a basin of milk
with it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Up she gets with the tow-cards, and the tailor with
the goose, and the two apprentices: the one with
the shears and the other with the sleeve-board, but
it eluded them all. The one apprentice made a snap
at it with the shears, but he fell into the ash-pit.
The tailor threw the goose and his wife the tow-cards;
but it wouldn&rsquo;t do; the bannock got away
and ran till it came to a little house by the road-side,
into which it ran. There was a weaver sitting on
his loom, and his wife was winding a skein of yarn.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Kitty,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;what&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; said
she, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s a wee bannock.&rdquo; &ldquo;It&rsquo;s welcome,&rdquo; said he,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
&ldquo;for our pottage was rather thin to-day. Catch
hold of it, my Girl; catch it.&rdquo; &ldquo;Yes, that I will,&rdquo;
said she. &ldquo;How now! why that&rsquo;s a clever bannock.
Stop it, Willie; stop it, Man.&rdquo; But it wouldn&rsquo;t be
stopped, and away it went over the hillock and ran
into the nearest house, straight up to the fire-side.
There was the good wife churning, and she said,
&ldquo;Come along, my wee Bannock. I have cream, but
no bread.&rdquo; However the bannock dodged round
the churn, and she after it, till she nearly upset the
churn, and before she could steady it the wee bannock
was off, down by the side of the stream into
the mill.</p>

<p>The miller was sifting meal; but when he looked
up and saw the bannock, he said, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a sign of
plenty when you&rsquo;re running about like that and no
one to look after you. But I like a bannock and
cheese, so come here, and I&rsquo;ll give you a night&rsquo;s lodging.&rdquo;
But the bannock wouldn&rsquo;t trust itself with
the miller and his cheese, so it turned and ran out
again, and the miller didn&rsquo;t trouble himself about it.</p>

<p>This time it rolled on gently till it came to a
smithy, and in it ran up to the anvil. The smith,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
who was making horse-nails, said, &ldquo;I like a stoup of
good ale and a well-toasted bannock, so you are just
the thing for me.&rdquo; But the bannock was frightened
when it heard him talk of the ale, so it ran off as hard
as it could split, and the smith after it, but all to no
purpose; for it was out of sight in a crack, and it ran
on till it came to a farm-house. In it went up to
the fire-side, where the farmer was plaiting straw
ropes. &ldquo;Why, Janet,&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;here&rsquo;s a bannock.
I&rsquo;ll have the half of&rsquo;t.&rdquo; &ldquo;Well, John, and I
the other half.&rdquo; But neither could get hold of it,
and off it was, up one side of the hill and down the
other, to the nearest house, and in it went up to the
fire.</p>

<p>The good folks were just sitting down to supper.
&ldquo;Shut the door,&rdquo; cried the good woman, &ldquo;for here&rsquo;s
a wee bannock come in to warm itself by our fire,
and it&rsquo;s just in time for supper.&rdquo;</p>

<p>When the bannock heard this it ran all about the
house, and got out at last, when it ran faster and faster
till it got to another house. As it ran in the folk
were just going to bed. The goodman was taking
off his breeches, and his wife raking out the fire.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; cried he. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a wee bannock,&rdquo;
said his wife. &ldquo;I could eat the half of it for all the
supper I had,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;Catch hold of it,&rdquo; cried
she, &ldquo;and I&rsquo;ll have a bit too. Throw your breeches
at it&mdash;there, stop it&mdash;stop it!&rdquo; The goodman threw
his breeches at it and nearly buried it, but it got
away and out of the house. The goodman ran after
it; and now a regular chase began, round the house,
through the garden, across the fields on to a common
among the furze, where he lost it, and he had to trot
home again half naked.</p>

<p>It had now grown quite dark, and the wee bannock
could not see an inch before it, so by mistake
it got into a fox&rsquo;s hole.</p>

<p>Now the fox had had no meat for two days, so it
made a snap at the bannock and it was gone in an
instant.</p>

<p>It would seem as if there were little use in the
wee bannock having escaped so many dangers, but
not so, for all its pursuers could do very well without
it, whereas the poor fox had fasted two days and
must have been really hungry.</p>

</div>

<p class="cap"><span class="upper">There</span> was once a widow who had a son,
and she called him Jock. Now, one day
she said to him, &ldquo;You are a lazy fellow,
but now you must go out and earn something
in order to help me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll do that willingly,&rdquo; said Jock. So away he
went, and fell in with a pedler, who said to him, &ldquo;If
you&rsquo;ll carry my pack all day, I&rsquo;ll give you a needle at
night.&rdquo; He carried the pack all day, receiving the
needle at night; and as he went on his way home to
his mother, he cut a bundle of rushes and put the
needle in the middle of them.</p>

<p>When he got home his Mother said to him, &ldquo;What
have you done, and brought home to-day?&rdquo; &ldquo;I met
with a pedler,&rdquo; said Jock, &ldquo;and carried his pack
for him, for which I received a needle, which you
may look for among the rushes.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Out upon you, for a blockhead,&rdquo; said his Mother,
&ldquo;you should have stuck it in your cap.&rdquo; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
mind that another time,&rdquo; said Jock.</p>

<p>The next day he overtook a man carrying plough-shares,
and the man said to him, &ldquo;If you&rsquo;ll help me
to carry my plough-shares during the day, I&rsquo;ll give
you one for yourself at night.&rdquo; &ldquo;Agreed,&rdquo; said Jock.
So at night he gets a plough-share, which he sticks
in his cap. On his way home he was thirsty, so he
went down to the river to have a drink, and as he
stooped the plough-share fell out of his cap and was
lost in the water. He then went home, and his
Mother said to him, &ldquo;Well, Jock, what have you
been doing to-day?&rdquo; And when he told her she cried
out, &ldquo;How stupid you are, Jock! you should have
tied a piece of string to it and trailed it after you
along the ground.&rdquo; &ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ll mind that another
time,&rdquo; said Jock.</p>

<p>Off he started the next morning and fell in with a
butcher. &ldquo;If you&rsquo;ll be my servant for the day,&rdquo; he
said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll give you a leg of mutton at night.&rdquo;
&ldquo;That is a bargain,&rdquo; said Jock. And after serving
his day out he got a leg of mutton, to which he tied<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
a piece of string and dragged it after him through
all the dust and dirt. When his Mother saw him
she exclaimed, &ldquo;Will you never grow wise? You
should have carried the leg of mutton on your
shoulder.&rdquo; &ldquo;Well, Mother, another time I shall
know better,&rdquo; was his answer.</p>

<p>The next day he went out as usual, and he met a
horse-dealer. He said, &ldquo;If you will help me with
my horses during the day, I&rsquo;ll give you one at night.&rdquo;
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll do that,&rdquo; said Jock. So after serving him he
received a horse as his day&rsquo;s wages. He tied the
animal&rsquo;s feet together, but was not able to lift it up;
so he left it and went home to his mother, whom he
told how he had tried to do as she bid him, but that
he could not lift the horse on to his shoulder to carry
it. &ldquo;Oh, you born idiot!&rdquo; she cried; &ldquo;could you
not have jumped on its back and ridden it home?&rdquo;
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll not forget that the next time,&rdquo; he promised.</p>

<p>The next day he overtook a drover driving some
cattle to a neighbouring town, and the drover said
to him, &ldquo;If you&rsquo;ll help me safely to the town with
my cattle, I&rsquo;ll give you a cow for your trouble.&rdquo;
This Jock agreed to; and when he got his promised<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a><br /><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
cow he jumped on to its back, and taking its tail
over his shoulder, he galloped along, in high glee,
towards home.</p>

<br /><span class="caption">Jock&rsquo;s Cure for Melancholy.</span>
</div>

<p>Now there was a very rich man who had an only
daughter, and she had such fits of melancholy that it
was sad to see her; so that, after trying every remedy
and consulting all the quacks in the country, he had
it publicly announced that whoever could make her
laugh should have her for his wife.</p>

<p>Though she was young and beautiful no one had
been found to cure her, and she was sitting in a very
melancholy state, at the window, when Jock came
galloping along on his cow, which seemed so highly
ridiculous to her that she burst out laughing.</p>

<p>Well, according to her father&rsquo;s promise, she was
married to Jock, and a grand wedding it was, and
a grand supper was prepared for the guests; but of
all the delicacies Jock was most pleased with some
honey he had eaten.</p>

<p>Now, after all the company had departed, excepting
the old priest that had married them, and who
had fallen asleep by the kitchen fire, Jock, who
could not forget the honey, said to his bride, &ldquo;Is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
there any more of that delicious honey we had for
supper?&rdquo; &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she answered, &ldquo;you will find
plenty more in jars in the kitchen cupboard.&rdquo; So he
went into the kitchen, where the lights had been put
out, and all had gone to bed, excepting the priest,
who was sleeping by the fire; and he found the honey
jars.</p>

<p>He thrust his hand into one of the jars to get at
some of the honey, but his hand would not come
out again, and he did not know what he should do,
when he bethought him of breaking the jar on the
hearth-stone.</p>

<p>Now, as already said, the kitchen was in darkness;
and Jock, mistaking a large white wig, which the
priest wore, for the hearth-stone, gave the poor man
such a whack on the head with the honey jar that
he screamed out murder; and Jock, frightened out
of his senses, ran out and hid himself among the
bee-hives.</p>

<p>That very night, as luck would have it, some
thieves came to steal the bee-hives, which they
bundled into a large plaid, and Jock with them
without knowing it. Off the thieves ran with their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
booty on their backs, and when they came to the
brook where Jock had dropped the plough-share,
one of them kicking his foot against it, cried out,
&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s a plough-share in the water.&rdquo; &ldquo;That is
mine,&rdquo; Jock cried from out of the plaid; and the
thieves thinking it was a ghost on their backs, let the
plaid, with its contents, fall into the water, and it
being tied up Jock could not get out, so was drowned
with all the bees.</p>

</div>

<p class="cap"><span class="upper">It</span> was before the introduction of railways,
into Ireland at any rate, that a certain
Irish Bishop had occasion to visit Dublin.
There was, no doubt, a public conveyance
of some sort or another of which the good Bishop
might have availed himself, but his lordship was a
portly gentleman and fond of his ease; besides which
his wife and daughter wished to make the journey
with him, and they never would for a moment have
listened to travelling in a dirty car or coach, so their
own comfortable carriage was got ready. I said the
Bishop was portly and fond of his ease, but by that
I did not mean to infer that all bishops are stout, for
I knew one who was a very lean man; nor did I
mean that portly personages are all fond of their
ease, that is, not more so than the rest of us are;
nor do I now mean that a lean man does not appreciate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
comfort. Be that as it may, the Bishop in
question had a handsome comfortable carriage which
he thought he might as well use; and, indeed, as his
lady and daughter were going with him, he had no
choice, so the carriage was used and his lordship&rsquo;s
horses too; and to save both, as well as the ladies,
the journey was performed in easy stages.</p>

<p>Now the Bishop was an advocate for a moderate
amount of exercise, and for this reason, as well as
to spare his horses as much as possible, he made a
point of alighting from his carriage at the foot of
the hills, and walking up to the top, unless, indeed,
the hill proved too steep.</p>

<p>On one occasion he had loitered behind admiring
the scenery, which was particularly wild and beautiful,
and the carriage had got out of sight. However,
as it always waited for him at the top of the hill,
that did not trouble him as long as he had only the
difficulties of the road to contend with; but soon
danger appeared in the shape of an ugly looking
fellow, who, suddenly starting up from behind a heap
of stones, stood right in front of him, effectually
stopping his progress, which was particularly vexatious.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a><br /><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
From the appearance of the stranger the Bishop
felt very much inclined to quicken his pace.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/ill33.jpg" width="396" height="522" alt="" />
<br /><span class="caption">The Bishop and the Highwayman.</span>
</div>

<p>&ldquo;What can I do for you, my good Man?&rdquo; said the
Bishop very civilly, and in his softest voice, for he
did not like the look of the man, nor of a dangerous
looking club he held in his hand.</p>

<p>&ldquo;As your Honour is so civil as to ask,&rdquo; the fellow
said, &ldquo;you may first of all give me your money, for
I&rsquo;m sartain sure so kind a gintleman would not like
to see a poor fellow in distress, when you can relieve
him by only putting your hand in your pocket.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Civilly as he spoke he was a determined looking
rascal, with whom it would evidently be of no use to
argue, so the Bishop gave him what silver he had
about him, hoping to get off with that; but he was
mistaken, for the fellow had no sooner put it into
his coat pocket than he said&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your Honour has made a mistake, for it&rsquo;s sure
I am a thorough gintleman like you could not
intend to give only a few paltry shillings. But I beg
your Riverence&rsquo;s pardon, for I see now that you are
an ornament of the blessed Church. It&rsquo;s some gold
pieces you intended to give me; but it will save your<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
Riverence trouble if you give me your purse.&rdquo; This
was accompanied by a scarcely perceptible movement
of the club, which however seemed a very
convincing argument, for his lordship immediately
produced his purse, which as quickly followed the
silver into the capacious pocket.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry to trouble your Honour, your Riverence
I mane, any further, for I see you&rsquo;re in a hurry,
and it&rsquo;s beg your pardon I do for the same; but I
judge you&rsquo;re going to Dublin, and you can have everything
in the big city for the asking; but here nothing
can be got for love or money, and you see that I
want a new coat and hat. Now I&rsquo;m sure so kind a
gintleman won&rsquo;t mind changing yours with me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;This is too much, my good Man,&rdquo; the Bishop
said, driven to resistance by this extraordinary demand.
&ldquo;Recollect that you are breaking the laws
of God and man, and think of the punishment in
this world and the next. Be satisfied, for you have
taken all my money, and my clothes I will not part
with.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, sure,&rdquo; was the answer, &ldquo;your Honor&rsquo;s
Riverence makes a mistake, for you gave me that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
bit of money, and it is that very kindness makes me
not believe that you mane to refuse me now. Pray
consider, and I&rsquo;ll wait with pleasure for another
answer, for I know you&rsquo;ll be sorry.&rdquo; He stepped
back a few paces, and, as if to while away the time
whilst waiting for the answer, he flourished his cudgel
about, first over his head, then on one side and then
on the other.</p>

<p>What was to be done? The poor Bishop saw that
help was hopeless and resistance equally so, and, after
a few moments&rsquo; hesitation, he took off his coat and
hat, laying them on the heap of stones by his side.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, bless your Riverence,&rdquo; the fellow said,
&ldquo;I knew you would not refuse me; but after all
your kindness I cannot allow you to be without a
coat and hat. It would be neither comfortable nor
dacent, and, therefore, just put on my coat. Indeed
I&rsquo;ll not take a refusal,&rdquo; he continued, as the Bishop
hesitated, and he helped his lordship on with his
tattered garment. He then removed his unresisting
victim&rsquo;s wig and placed his old hat on his head.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now I hope you intend to let me go,&rdquo; the Bishop
said.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I have one more favour to ask, and then I will
bid your Riverence a very good morning. I must
beg the loan of your watch till I have the honor of
seeing you again, for there is no watch or clock for
miles around, and it is very awkward, for I don&rsquo;t
know when to be at my work, and I&rsquo;m afraid of cheating
my employer out of some of the time due to him.
Your Honor can easily get another.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Will you never be satisfied? But beware of
keeping me any longer, for there is my carriage close
by, and the servants, whom I have only to call to my
help.&rdquo; This the Bishop said in despair, pointing
along the road as he spoke, but he had a quick reply.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t trouble yourself to call, for I saw your
Riverence&rsquo;s carriage pass, and it is far out of hearing.&rdquo;
This his lordship knew well, so he gave up
his watch, and was at length allowed to depart. He
hurried on, for he was afraid of another demand being
made upon him, and it was not long before he reached
his carriage.</p>

<p>Much astonishment was caused by his extraordinary
appearance, and after he had related his adventure
his wife said to him: &ldquo;Throw off that filthy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
coat, my Dear, for we shall soon reach a town where
you can buy something more befitting you to wear.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not so easily, my Dear,&rdquo; was his reply, &ldquo;for I
have not a shilling of money left.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, never mind,&rdquo; his wife said, &ldquo;take off the
nasty thing, for positively you cannot come into the
carriage that figure. I&rsquo;ll give you my cloak to cover
your shoulders.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The good man was not used to resist his wife, so
he took off the coat, throwing it upon the road. As
he did so some silver fell out, which induced him
to make his servant examine it, and to his joy and
relief all his property was found in the pocket.</p>

<p>The party reached Dublin without any further
adventure, and a few days after received intelligence
of the capture of the Highwayman.</p>

<p class="stl1">Fiddling Jackey.</p>


<div class="figleft">
<img src="images/ill-t3.jpg" width="71" height="76" alt="T" title="T" />
</div>

<p class="cap"><span class="upper">There</span> was once a little boy, who led a
very unhappy life, for his father was
tipsy from morning till night, and he
had no mother to soothe and console him
when he had met with ill-treatment, which happened
almost daily.</p>

<p>I cannot tell you exactly how long ago this was,
but it must be a long, long time, for there were
fairies then, and the birds, trees, and flowers sang
and spoke, which you know has not happened within
your recollection, at all events.</p>

<p>Jackey&rsquo;s father, for Jackey was the little boy&rsquo;s
name, was village musician, and had once played the
violin remarkably well, but since he had taken to
drinking had grown so careless that his scraping
was a horror to all who could hear at all, that the
dogs even howled in disgust, and probably in pain,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
for the noise they made was piteous in the extreme.</p>

<p>Now, when the drunken fiddler reeled home at
night, accompanied by the most dissolute of the
village, the shouting of these, the horrid scraping
of the fiddle, and the discordant chorus of some
twenty or thirty dogs, made the more steady and respectable
portion of the community tremble in their
beds, with some undefined fear.</p>

<p>All this, you must know, happened in Germany,
where in every cottage of the villages there is, at
least, one dog, and where the watchman, who is
generally the swineherd as well, no doubt was not
over sober himself, and more likely to add to the
noise than stop it.</p>

<p>Though the fiddler was a sad reprobate, and his
playing of the worst description, he was tolerated;
for the fact is that the most of the elder portion
of the villagers cared only for drinking, and the
younger ones thought of nothing but dancing; so
he was good enough for them after all.</p>

<p>His disorderly life and cruelty had killed his poor
wife, Jackey&rsquo;s mother, who would have looked upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
death as a real blessing, had she not feared for the
future of her young son; however, Jackey, who was
eight years old, had the thoughtlessness of youth
and good health to support him, though, it is true,
he cried bitterly after his father had been beating
him, and felt sorrowful enough when he had not
enough to eat, which happened but too often.</p>

<p>Jackey still remembered the time when, though
at rare intervals, his father played really well; and
the sweet sounds of music had so entered his very
soul that he felt a secret consolation within him,
amidst all his troubles.</p>

<p>This love of music, though it consoled him, occasionally
caused him more bitter sorrow than the
most cruel beatings; for when he looked at the
violin, hanging against the wall, neglected and
covered with mud, he thought of the sweet sounds
that were still within it, though there was no one
to bring them out.</p>

<p>Now, one day, when Jackey had been staring
longer than usual at the violin, and his mind was
filled with sad thoughts, his father happened to come
in, and the poor boy, mustering up all his courage,
said&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My dear Father, do not be angry if I ask what
the poor fiddle has done to you that you neglect it
so? Take care or it will die too, as my dear good
mother did, of a broken heart.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The only answer to this was a sound thrashing;
and, as the beating had been more severe than usual,
so Jackey cried longer and more bitterly, all by himself,
for his father had gone again; but, as the pain
grew less, his crying was not so violent nor loud;
then he thought he heard a voice, like sobbing,
come from the wall.</p>

<p>There was no mistaking it, the sobbing proceeded
from the violin, and Jackey&rsquo;s tears burst forth afresh;
but there must be an end to all things, and when
he had become calmer, he got on a chair, so as to
be nearer the instrument, and whispered&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My dear Fiddle, you pity me, and now I have a
friend in the place of my good lost mother. But
you, too, I am afraid, are not more happy than she
was. Tell me if I can do anything for you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I do pity you,&rdquo; the violin answered, &ldquo;for you
are a good boy, and I wish to console you for the
loss of your mother, and make you forget all the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a><br /><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
hardships you have to suffer. At the same time,
you can do me a very great service. Take me down,
and when you have cleaned me and put me in proper
order, I will teach you how to make me sing again,
better than ever I used to do. Then I shall be
happy, and you, my poor Boy, will forget your sorrow,
for I know that sweet sounds will console you
in all your troubles.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="figcenter">

<br /><span class="caption">The neglected Fiddle repining.</span>
</div>

<p>Jackey said, sorrowfully, &ldquo;Oh, how I wish to
make you happy! But if I take you down, my father
will beat me, and, what is worse, perhaps, in his
passion, throw you against the wall, and dash you
to pieces.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Be not afraid, but do as I tell you,&rdquo; the violin
answered; &ldquo;you know that your father is at the
tavern all day long till dusk, when he comes to fetch
me, and if, by chance, he does come in, he never
notices anything. I promise you no harm shall
happen to you; so take me down and carry me, with
the bow, into the forest, where, by the side of the
stream, I will teach you how to make me bring forth
sweet sounds.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You know better than I do what is safe to do,
so I will take you to the forest, as you tell me.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span></p>

<p>As he said this, Jackey took down the violin, and
having cleaned and tuned it, according to its own
directions, he carried it and the bow into the forest,
where he seated himself by the side of the
rivulet.</p>

<p>The breeze played between the leaves and branches
of the trees, the leaves and branches rustled, the birds
sang sweetly, the stream murmured softly, and all
seemed to say&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Welcome, Jackey! welcome to the forest!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, how delightful it is here!&rdquo; Jackey cried;
&ldquo;and now, my dear Fiddle, teach me to imitate all
these sweet sounds.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The violin told him how to hold the bow and
where to place his fingers; and all the birds came
round him, first one whistling a note till he could
imitate it, and then another giving him the next
note, and so on; the rivulet, too, and the wind assisted;
and then came the nightingale and taught
him how to join the different notes together, that
they might harmonize and form sounds agreeable to
the ear.</p>

<p>Jackey was so attentive, and did all so well, that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
the trees, the flowers, the stream, and all the birds
cried out&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Bravo, Jackey!&rdquo;</p>

<p>As soon as evening began to draw near Jackey
put up his fiddle and prepared to go home, when
all the voices, with one accord, cried&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come again soon, and we will sing together.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Jackey went the very next day, and every succeeding
day, and he made the flowers join in the universal
harmony. His dear fiddle seconded him in all his
endeavours, so that very shortly he imitated all the
voices of the forest with the greatest accuracy.</p>

<p>It happened about this time that the landlord of
the village inn died, leaving a widow, who wished
for nothing better than to give him a successor as
speedily as possible; but though she was rich, and
the business most thriving, yet no suitors appeared.</p>

<p>Jackey&rsquo;s father, in his drunken moments, thought
he would propose to the widow, for he said to himself
that, when master of the inn, he could have as
much drink as he liked without paying for it; but
when a little more sober his courage failed him, for
she was the veriest shrew, and the charms of her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
person were no more engaging than those of her
character.</p>

<p>Her hair was neither red, brown, nor black, but a
sort of dirty coloured mixture of the three, and each
hair seemed to go a different way. Her nose was
very, very long, not projecting, but hanging down,
like the beak of some of the small tribes of parrots.
I think the love-birds have such beaks, but I can
scarcely compare her to those, for certainly she had
nothing of the love about her. Well, her nose, anyhow,
was like a parrot&rsquo;s beak, but flattened down, and
that on one side, or else it would have covered her
mouth, which would have been no great harm, for
that was as ugly a feature as any other, and not
improved by having only half the due number of
teeth, which, unlike the nose, stuck out instead of
hanging down. Her eyes were like those of a cat,
and one squinted awfully. Shaggy eyebrows and a
pointed hairy chin complete her portrait. Her
figure was long, lank, and shapeless&mdash;shapeless not
meaning no shape at all, but an ugly shape.</p>

<p>Most people have some redeeming qualities, or
quality at least, but no one had yet discovered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
hers, and no one had been found bold enough to
propose to the interesting widow, though she let it
be clearly understood that she wished to remain a
widow no longer.</p>

<p>Jackey&rsquo;s father had so often made up his mind
to make her an offer that at last his mind became
familiarized to the horror, and if not in love with
the widow, he was decidedly so with her beer and
spirits; so one evening, having screwed up his courage
to the highest pitch, he, in a few words, offered
himself as a husband.</p>

<p>The widow took but a few minutes to consider,
that, though he was a drunken, worthless fellow, he
was better than no husband at all; so she did not
give him time to draw back, but accepted him with
all his faults.</p>

<p>The wedding followed with the least possible loss
of time, and the guests drank deeply to the health
and happiness of the bride and bridegroom, but the
happy husband drank more than any of them. This
was a happy beginning; but how short-lived is happiness,
for to his this was not only the beginning but
also the end.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span></p>

<p>How changed was everything the very next day!
Beer and spirits were carefully locked up, and the
poor fiddler was put under the water-cure treatment,
and this was the first of a series of strictly sober days.
He did not resign himself to petticoat government
without a struggle, but in every way she was more
than his match.</p>

<p>Adversity is the bitterest of all medicines, but
frequently acts most beneficially on the soul, if not
on the body. So it proved with the fiddler, for
though, during the first few days of his new life,
his temper was sourer than ever, by degrees his
spirit was broken, and the outbursts of passion became
less frequent. Passion was of no avail, for it never
gained him his object, and his amiable spouse still
remained his better half.</p>

<p>Example had its effect also, for as he daily suffered
from his wife&rsquo;s intolerable temper, her unamiability,
which at first roused his anger, now caused disgust
and horror, and occasionally he could not help reflecting
that in many respects he had been like her.
As yet the improvement in his character was involuntary,
forced upon him, as it were, and failed to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
soothe his mind and feelings; but Jackey, being
treated with less harshness, began to feel for the first
time that he had a father.</p>

<p>The good boy, looking on his father now without
fear, saw the dejection he was constantly labouring
under, and, as much as he had dreaded and almost
abhorred the harsh brutal man, he now pitied his suffering
father, so that he took every opportunity to
get near to him, sometimes venturing a remark; and
one day, when he saw him in a particularly desponding
mood, he fetched the violin and played the voices
of the forest to him.</p>

<p>Jackey&rsquo;s father was at first bewildered by the
tender emotions to which his heart had so long been
a stranger, but as the sweet sounds continued, it
seemed as if his nature were changed and a new
life dawned upon him. He clasped his son to his
breast and burst into tears. When he became a
little calm, he said&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How beautifully you play, Jackey! How did
you learn? But why inquire? You have always
been a good boy, and kinder, better spirits than those
of the earth, seeing you so neglected by your unnatural<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
father, have taken compassion on you. I have
led a bad life, but now I see my faults, and I will
be always kind to you, my Son. Oh, Jackey, your
good mother will forgive me for all my past cruelty
when she sees how I watch over her dear child!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dear Father,&rdquo; Jackey said, &ldquo;my dear, good
mother, who is in heaven, forgives you now. Oh,
if she were but here to share our happiness!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Play me that tune once more,&rdquo; his Father said,
&ldquo;and then we will go to your step-mother, and I
will beg and pray of her to send you to school, for
I can do nothing, my poor Boy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They went to that amiable lady, with whom,
however, all prayers were in vain. She said she
would not spend a farthing of her money on father
or son, but that Jackey should be a shoemaker;
that she would send him to her brother, who was
a shoemaker in a neighbouring village, where he
would soon be broken of his idle habits. Jackey
said he would not be a shoemaker; whereupon she
gave him a slap on the face, which made his ears
sing and bright spots dance before his eyes, promising
at the same time to break his fiddle over his head.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span></p>

<p>Jackey, however, was none the less determined
not to be a shoemaker, and his only trouble was how
to keep the dear fiddle out of her way. The next
morning very early he was waked by a kiss from
his father, who said&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Get up quickly, my Boy, and dress yourself, for
I cannot do anything for you here, not even protect
you, and it will be better to trust to the kindness of
strangers than go to that cruel woman&rsquo;s brother,
who no doubt is as bad as herself. We must part,
my dear Jackey, but I do not fear for you, for wherever
you play the airs you played me yesterday, you
will be sure to find friends. Take your fiddle then,
and wander forth into the world, and if you remain
a good boy, as you have hitherto been, God
will watch over you and protect you. Make haste;
and in the meantime I will see what I can find to
eat for you to take with you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Jackey was ready when his father returned with
some provisions done up in a bag. &ldquo;Now follow
me,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and take care that you do not make
any noise, so that no one may hear us.&rdquo; They got
out safely and went straight to the forest, where<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
Jackey&rsquo;s Father stopping, said to him, &ldquo;You are
now safe out of the clutches of your wicked stepmother,
and we must part; but, my dear Boy, we
will put our trust in Providence, and, if my life
is spared a few years longer, I shall see you again,
for when you prosper in the world, and prosper
you will, my Son, you will not forget your old
father.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let me remain with you, my dear Father,&rdquo;
Jackey said, &ldquo;for you are not happy, and I will try
to cheer you with my fiddle. I do not mind my
stepmother&rsquo;s cruelty.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, my Child, it must not be,&rdquo; his Father
answered, &ldquo;I have deserved my fate, and will try
and bear it with resignation; but fortune awaits you
in the world, far from here. Do not cry; and now,
with my blessing on you, we must part.&rdquo; He
pressed his son to his breast, and turned back without
uttering another word.</p>

<p>Jackey watched him till he was out of sight, and
then sadly went on his way into the forest, he knew
and cared not whither. After a time he reached
the very spot, by the side of the rivulet, where he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
had first sat with the violin and listened to the voices
of the forest; and as he seated himself, the rustling
in the trees and the murmuring of the stream joined
with the different notes of the birds in forming the
harmony of music. The sadness of his heart gradually
became softened, and, taking the violin out of
the bag in which he always kept it, he again imitated
the various sounds he heard, the birds vieing
with each other to teach him something new.</p>

<p>Returning cheerfulness and the freshness of the
air reminded Jackey that he had not yet eaten anything,
so he made a good breakfast off the provisions
put up by his father, not forgetting to give
some crumbs to the birds that gathered about him;
and with a light heart he continued his journey
deeper into the forest. He thus wandered on all
day, and neither found the time long, nor was he
weary; for there was constantly something new to
see, and hear, and imitate upon his dear fiddle.
The sun had sunk below the horizon, tingeing a few
feathery clouds with a beautiful pink, and the little
wanderer saw no end to the forest; but that did not
trouble him, and he chose a soft mossy spot for a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
bed, on which he lay down, and was soon fast
asleep, forgetful of time and everything else.</p>

<p>Nothing disturbed his quiet slumbers till about
midnight, when a sudden light flashing across his
eyes awakened him. He started up, and saw it as
light as day all around. Yet it was not daylight;
it was more like the light of the moon, but milder
and warmer. He looked through some bushes,
where the light seemed strongest, and stood transfixed
with amazement at what he saw. Hundreds
of the most lovely beings were dancing in a circle,
whilst thousands of others seemed to fill the air
around. Some were sitting, swinging backwards
and forwards, on the different flowers, whilst others,
in countless numbers, appeared gliding up and down
the rays of light. He thought he had never seen
anything so beautiful as the little aerial beings before
him. Though so very small&mdash;for they were not
nearly the size of Jackey&mdash;their forms were fully
developed, and of the most exquisite elegance and
grace. The maidens in particular, who seemed all
of the age of seventeen or eighteen, were lovely in
the extreme.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span></p>

<p>Jackey knew they must be fairies; and two of the
number who were a little taller, and, if possible, more
beautiful than the rest, besides that they wore silver
crowns, he judged to be the king and the queen.
Dazzled by the light and the beauty of the scene
before him, he was for a time lost in admiration;
but gradually the sweet tones, as the fairies sang,
gained the ascendancy, and all the other senses
seemed absorbed by that of hearing. As the fairies
danced, they sang, and were joined by thousands of
other voices&mdash;in sounds, now of the most lively merriment,
then softly till they became solemn, when
again they burst forth in the wildest strains. The
dance never ceased; but as some withdrew from the
ring their places were taken by others, who began
the song anew.</p>

<p>Jackey had no knowledge of time, whether the
music continued for minutes only or for hours; however,
it became fainter and fainter till it melted away,
and he found himself in darkness; but long, long
after he lay down again it seemed as if he still heard
the fairy song, and when he awoke in the morning
it still sounded in his ears.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/ill35.jpg" width="393" height="518" alt="" />
<br /><span class="caption">The Sight Jackey saw.</span>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;How lovely!&rdquo; Jackey exclaimed; &ldquo;oh, could
I but imitate those sweet sounds!&rdquo; &ldquo;Try,&rdquo; the
violin said from its bag. &ldquo;Well thought,&rdquo; Jackey
cried; and taking it out, immediately began to
play the fairy song. He played it over and over
again, and each time better, till at length he said,
kissing his dear violin, &ldquo;Well done, Fiddle, we can
do it now.&rdquo; Then Jackey ate his breakfast, and
having tried the song once more, he resumed his
wanderings through the forest. He stopped several
times to play the fairy song again, trying also his
other tunes, to see that they had not been driven
out of his memory by these still sweeter sounds;
and having had his breakfast very early, had made a
finish of his stock of provisions, but that did not
trouble him, though there seemed no end to the forest.</p>

<p>About mid-day, however, he began to feel hungry
again, and hastened his steps, in hopes of finding
some outlet from the forest, or at least some woodman&rsquo;s
hut. He began to feel some anxiety for the
future; but he did not despair, for he was a good
boy, and put his trust in Providence. The birds
sang merrily, as if to cheer him; and soon he saw<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
that the forest became lighter, nor was it long
before he found himself on the highway, and at no
great distance stood a village.</p>

<p>Anxious as he was to reach some human habitations,
when he was outside the forest he turned
round to bid it farewell, and thank his dear birds for
their kindness to him. A farewell sounded back,
and cheerfully he went on his way to the village.
He remembered his father having said that wheresoever
he played he would be sure to find friends;
and no sooner did he reach the first houses, than he
took out his violin and began to play. First he
played the voices of the forest, and soon all the
people were at their windows and their doors, listening
to him; but when he played the fairy song,
they came out and surrounded him, and he had to
begin again and again.</p>

<p>There was now a contest amongst the principal
inhabitants of the village who should take the wonderful
boy to their home, when the clergyman and
his wife carried him off.</p>

<p>Jackey would not accept their kindness without
telling them that he could not stay long, for his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
father had sent him to seek his fortune in the world,
that his father was not happy at home, and that he
was going back to fetch him as soon as he had made
his fortune.</p>

<p>The good people promised that they would not
keep him longer than he felt inclined to remain
with them. They were, however, so kind that
week after week still found him there, and he was
so intelligent and docile that every one loved him.
Living now with people of good education, Jackey
soon felt his ignorance, and applied himself so diligently
to his studies, in which he was assisted both
by the clergyman and his wife, that he made rapid
progress.</p>

<p>He did not neglect his music, and frequently went
back into the forest&mdash;no one interfering with his
wanderings. Neither did he forget his father, nor
give up the intention of seeking his fortune in the
world, though he was delayed by the persuasion
of his kind protectors, who, however, gave their
consent to his departure after he had been with them
about a year, providing him with every necessary for
his journey, as also with a small supply of money.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span></p>

<p>Jackey had improved as much in person as in
mind, but retained his former innocent simplicity
of heart and kindly feelings, so that his feathered
friends loved him still, and he was as happy as the
day was long.</p>

<p>He visited one country after another, passing
from village to village, and from town to town; and
wherever he played, both old and young surrounded
him, and every one was ready to befriend him.
Thus year after year passed away, and Jackey had
grown to be a tall, handsome youth of about nineteen,
with flowing black hair, large dark eyes, and
an expression of cheerfulness and good humour.
His playing was celebrated far and wide, but, more
particularly, when he played the fairy song every
one was carried away by admiration and surprise.</p>

<p>In each country he visited many inducements
had been held out to detain him; but a secret impulse
drew him on till he came to a large and
powerful kingdom, which he found plunged in the
deepest mourning; for not only had the queen just
died, but the most beautiful of princesses, her daughter,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
was brought to the very verge of death by grief
at the loss of her beloved mother.</p>

<p>Her royal father, whose only child she was, in
the utmost despair, had promised half his kingdom
to the physician who should save her; but the only
remedy the most learned could propose was any excitement
that would distract her from her grief, for
it was that alone that was consuming her. This
remedy was beyond their art, and the king proclaimed
that whoever cured the princess should be
the inheritor of his throne and the husband of his
daughter, if she consented to marry him.</p>

<p>Jackey, on hearing this proclamation, determined
to try what his art could do to cure the princess,
since all that was required was to enliven her, and
make her forget her grief. He trusted that, with
the help of Providence, he should succeed; and that,
if even the princess would not marry him, which
he scarcely dared to hope, he might still receive
a reward sufficient to secure his old father&rsquo;s future
happiness, besides having the consolation of saving
the life of a young lady universally beloved.</p>

<p>He went boldly to the palace, where he was immediately<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a><br /><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
admitted, on stating what his errand was;
for the king had given orders not to refuse admittance
to any one, however humble, who came to
cure his daughter.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/ill36.jpg" width="392" height="523" alt="" />
<br /><span class="caption">Jackey playing to the Princess.</span>
</div>

<p>The king was much surprised and disappointed
when he saw Jackey; but after he had received an
explanation of the means intended to be employed,
he became more reconciled, and ordered him to be
conducted to the princess&rsquo;s apartment.</p>

<p>Jackey gazed with admiration at the beautiful
form before him; and to the interest he before felt
was added pity, for the princess lay in bed with
closed eyes and so pale as if death had already laid
its icy hand upon her. He felt that he would willingly
lay down life itself to restore colour and animation
to that lovely face, and determined to exert
his utmost skill in her behalf.</p>

<p>First he played the voices of the forest&mdash;the soft
breeze gliding through the leaves, the low murmur
of the stream, and the gentle warbling of the birds;
then, as the princess&rsquo;s attention was attracted, he
made his violin speak louder and louder, and the
Princess exclaimed, &ldquo;How came I into the forest?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
Oh! how delightful it is! Sing on, you darling
birds!&rdquo; At length she opened her eyes, and sitting
up in the bed, looked about her in amazement.</p>

<p>Jackey now played the fairy song; and when he
had finished, she said&mdash;&ldquo;Go on, gentle Youth, I entreat
you. You have been sent by heaven to call
me back to life.&rdquo; She sank back upon her pillow,
and as Jackey continued to play, she fell into a soft
sleep, with a smile on her lovely face.</p>

<p>The king, having been informed of all that had
happened, hastened to his daughter&rsquo;s room; and the
calm expression of her features, together with the
assurance of the head physician that all danger had
now passed over, made him, for the moment, forget
all his sorrow; and embracing Jackey, he assured
him of his everlasting gratitude.</p>

<p>The next day the princess awoke, restored to
health; and when her preserver was presented to
her by the king, she received him with the sweetest
smile, and thanked him in the kindest terms. But
that was not all Jackey&rsquo;s reward; for when the princess
was told of the promise made by her royal
father to whoever should save her life, she declared<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
herself ready to fulfil that promise, as soon as the
time of mourning for her departed mother had
passed.</p>

<p>They were, however, betrothed before the whole
court, and the king publicly proclaimed that, next
to himself, Jackey should be the first in the land.
An establishment in every way befitting a prince of
the royal blood was appointed him, and he lived in
the closest intimacy with the king and his amiable
daughter.</p>

<p>Jackey, however, in all his splendour, and by the
side of his future bride, did not forget his old father,
nor the promise he had made him; so he begged
permission of the king to go and visit him, which
was immediately granted.</p>

<p>He set out on his journey to the village where he
was born, attended by a numerous retinue, travelling
day and night till he reached the forest where he had
learned the first notes of music, the foundation of all
his fortune. He remembered all the trees, but the
whole generation of birds that had known him had
long since died. In his heart, however, he thanked
them for their kindness, and in remembrance of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
them he passed on in silence, having left his attendants
at the beginning of the forest.</p>

<p>His heart beat with anxiety and fear, lest his
father should no longer be living, for it was more
than ten years since he had left his home; but when
he reached the stream where he had first sat in the
forest he saw an old man sitting by its side. Jackey
immediately recognized his father, but the old man
did not see him, for he was plunged in sorrow.</p>

<p>Wiping a tear from his eyes, he said, &ldquo;Am I
never to see my dear Jackey again? For how many
years have I come here every day, till gradually all
his friends have died off&mdash;and he, too, I am afraid,
must be dead; and I am the cause of his death, for
it was I persuaded him to go out into the world.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Jackey now took out his violin, which he had carried
with him, and played the tune with which he
had first soothed his father&rsquo;s grief. The old man
recognized the notes, and he cried out, &ldquo;That is my
own Jackey! Come to my arms, my dear Boy!&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was long before either could find words; but
then the old man told him that his stepmother was
dead; and Jackey related all his adventures, and his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
present happiness and splendour. Jackey went with
his father to the village; but the next day he had
him removed to where he had left his followers, and
they all returned, without loss of time, to the king,
and Jackey&rsquo;s future wife.</p>

<p>Jackey and his father were received with great
rejoicings, and when the time of mourning for the
late queen was over, Jackey was married to the
lovely princess, with whom he spent a long life of
happiness and peace, reigning with justice and wisdom
over the kingdom after the king and his own
old father were dead.</p>

<p class="cap"><span class="upper">Once</span> upon a time there was a teeny-tiny
woman, who lived in a teeny-tiny house
in a teeny-tiny village. Now one day
this teeny-tiny woman put on her teeny-tiny
bonnet, and went out of her teeny-tiny house to
take a teeny-tiny walk. And when this teeny-tiny
woman had gone a teeny-tiny way she came to a
teeny-tiny gate, and went into a teeny-tiny church-yard.</p>

<p>And when this teeny-tiny woman had got into the
teeny-tiny churchyard she saw a teeny-tiny bone
on a teeny-tiny grave, and the teeny-tiny woman
said to her teeny-tiny self, &ldquo;This teeny-tiny bone
will make me some teeny-tiny soup for my teeny-tiny
supper.&rdquo; So the teeny-tiny woman put the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
teeny-tiny bone into her teeny-tiny pocket, and went
home to her teeny-tiny house.</p>

<p>Now when the teeny-tiny woman got home to
her teeny-tiny house she was a teeny-tiny tired; so
she went up her teeny-tiny stairs to her teeny-tiny
bed, and put the teeny-tiny bone into a teeny-tiny
cupboard. And when this teeny-tiny woman had
been to sleep a teeny-tiny time she was awakened
by a teeny-tiny voice from the teeny-tiny cupboard,
which said&mdash;&ldquo;Give me my bone!&rdquo;</p>

<p>At this the teeny-tiny woman was a teeny-tiny
frightened, so she hid her teeny-tiny head under the
teeny-tiny clothes, and went to sleep again.</p>

<p>And when she had been asleep a teeny-tiny time
the teeny-tiny voice again cried out from the teeny-tiny
cupboard a teeny-tiny louder&mdash;&ldquo;Give me my
bone!&rdquo;</p>

<p>This made the teeny-tiny woman a teeny-tiny
more frightened, and she hid her teeny-tiny head a
teeny-tiny further under the teeny-tiny clothes. And
when the teeny-tiny woman had been to sleep again
a teeny-tiny time the teeny-tiny voice from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a><br /><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
teeny-tiny cupboard said again a teeny-tiny louder&mdash;&ldquo;Give
me my bone!&rdquo;</p>

<p>And this teeny-tiny woman was a teeny-tiny bit
more frightened, but she put her teeny-tiny head out
of the teeny-tiny clothes, and said in her loudest
teeny-tiny voice&mdash;&ldquo;Take it!&rdquo;</p>

<p class="stl1">The Cannibal Cow.</p>


<div class="figleft">
<img src="images/ill-i2.jpg" width="72" height="76" alt="I" title="I" />
</div>

<p class="cap"><span class="upper">It</span> was in the year &mdash;&mdash;. But why should I
insult you by being more particular in date
than that it was during the Irish rebellion,
when, one dreadfully stormy night, old
Goff, with his wife, daughter, and only son, Tim,
were sitting in the kitchen, which not only served as
general sitting-room, but was also the old couple&rsquo;s
bed-room? The wind howled and blew in gusts,
shaking the windows and doors as one without, in a
hurry to get in, amongst whose virtues patience could
not be numbered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This is a fearful night,&rdquo; old Goff said, &ldquo;and
fearful work, may be, is going on just now; for I
heard from neighbour Flanagan that the red-coats
have been seen in the neighbourhood. Go, Tim,
and see that all the doors are well fastened; and
when the old woman has given us our supper,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
we&rsquo;ll get to bed, for that is the safest place these
times.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The old man had no sooner spoken than there
was a tap at the door&mdash;at first, gentle; as, however,
neither father nor son moved, but sat staring at
each other in fear and trembling, the knocking
grew louder and louder. At length Tim whispered,
&ldquo;Hadn&rsquo;t you best go to the door, Father, for that will
impose upon them more, if it&rsquo;s thaves they are, and
show more respect, like, if it&rsquo;s the red-coats?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, no, my Son!&rdquo; the old man whispered back,
&ldquo;you go; for then they will see that you are safely
at home, like a steady lad, and not out with those
wild boys, who are the cause of all these troubles.
Go, my Son; but don&rsquo;t open the door, for the life of
ye, but ask the gintlemen, civil, Who might be there,
and what they might be wanting?&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was no help for it, so poor Tim crept to
the door, and, after listening whether he heard the
cocking of pistols or the clanking of swords, mustered
courage to ask who was there.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And who should it be, sure,&rdquo; was answered from
without, &ldquo;but Paddy, auld Paddy the Piper? Och!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a><br /><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
then let me in, darlint, that I may warm and dry
mesel&rsquo;, for it&rsquo;s caulder than the &lsquo;Squire&rsquo;s greetin&rsquo;, and
as damp as the say itsel&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/ill38.jpg" width="392" height="519" alt="" />
<br /><span class="caption">A Terror-stricken Household.</span>
</div>

<p>Without answering him, Tim ran back to his
father, who, in the mean time, had put out the light,
and had got as far as the kitchen-door to listen.
Now Tim, in his hurry, rushed upon the old man,
who went rolling down, and Tim, to save himself,
caught hold of the table, which he upset, and he
himself fell sprawling upon the floor. Not being
hurt, he went to help his father, who was shouting
thieves and murder, and it was some time before his
son could convince him that the place was not full
of thieves, but that it was only Paddy the Piper who
wanted to come in.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nay, lave me in pace,&rdquo; he said, as Tim tried to
raise him up, &ldquo;for I&rsquo;m dead, sure!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But what about Paddy?&rdquo; Tim asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And are ye sure it&rsquo;s Paddy it is, and that it is
by himself he is?&rdquo; And then the old man added&mdash;&ldquo;If
it&rsquo;s the Piper himself, I think bad not to give
him the bit and the sup; but ye mustn&rsquo;t let him in,
Tim, for sure it&rsquo;s Paddy has a baddish name, and if<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
he&rsquo;s found here we shall all swing for&rsquo;t. But take
the kay, my Boy, and let him into Katty&rsquo;s shed,
where he can be as comfortable, like, as the priest
himself in his own bed, and he shall not go without
his supper.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Now Katty, you must know, was old Goff&rsquo;s best
and favourite cow, and as such had a shed to herself,
to which Tim led the Piper; and when Paddy had
a good large mug of whisky, he forgot that he was
wet and cold. We will not assist at old Goff&rsquo;s recovery
from being &ldquo;murthered quite,&rdquo; but suppose
him, as well as the others, safely in bed; and as we
shall be busy with the Piper we will not disturb
them till the morning.</p>

<p>Paddy was so warm and comfortable after his
supper, but more particularly after the whisky, that
he felt one drop more would make him the happiest
man in all Ireland; but he dared not risk offending
old Goff by disturbing him again, for he always
found a good friend in him when his wanderings
took him that way. What was to be done? He
tried to sleep, but it would not do; though it was
not the want of a bed that troubled him, for it was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
little Paddy knew of that, except by name, and,
indeed, Katty gave him the best of accommodation;
but yet the comfort was fast oozing out of
him.</p>

<p>Now Paddy had a friend who, quietly and quite
in private, distilled the best of spirit, and there was
no fear of his being in bed&mdash;at least, not at night.
True, he lived full four miles off, and most of the
way lay across a dreary bog; but now that Paddy
was once with him in imagination he found less rest
than ever.</p>

<p>Tim had carefully locked Katty&rsquo;s door; but, though
old, the Piper was still active, so made nothing of
clambering up to a hole in the roof&mdash;for where is
the shed or cabin to be found in Ireland that has not
a hole in the roof? if, indeed, what should be the
roof is not one big hole. In dear old Ireland everything
is old, excepting the hearts and spirits of its people.
Once outside the shed, Paddy made the best of his
way towards his friend&rsquo;s; and expectation giving
strength and activity to his legs, he ran briskly on,
when, all at once, he was brought to a stand&mdash;not
because he was out of breath from running, but from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
astonishment at the fruit borne by a sturdy old tree
he had just reached.</p>

<p>A man, well and securely hanged, was dangling
from a branch of the tree, with his toes most provokingly
just beyond reach of the ground.</p>

<p>Paddy peered at him through the dark, to see
which of his friends it was, and then addressed him
thus:&mdash;&ldquo;Och! Murphy, me lad! and is it yerself
I run my nose agin here in the dark? but I forgie
yer for not gettin&rsquo; out o&rsquo; the way, seeing that yer
movements are not quite yer own. Now tell me what
has brought yer here in this ugly fix? But
how&rsquo;s this?&rdquo; he continued, examining his friend still
more closely&mdash;&ldquo;and was it for this dance yer put on
them iligant boots? Why, Murphy, I shouldn&rsquo;t
know yer if I didn&rsquo;t see that it&rsquo;s yerself! But now,&rdquo;
Paddy continued, talking to himself, &ldquo;his dance is over,
and what will he be wanting with his boots?
I&rsquo;m sartain he won&rsquo;t mind if I borrow them, for sure
me own brogues are none of the best. But why,
my auld Friend,&rdquo; he said, again addressing the hanging
man, &ldquo;why didn&rsquo;t yer put on yer Sunday best<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
intirely, for yer no better than a scarecrow dangling
there?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Paddy examined himself from head to foot, and
then, shaking his head, he muttered&mdash;&ldquo;No, I canna
better mesel&rsquo;, &rsquo;cepting with the boots, which I&rsquo;ll
make bold to take, trusting poor Murphy won&rsquo;t feel
his feet cauld.&rdquo; After thus alternately soliloquising
and addressing his friend, Paddy set himself to work
to pull off the dead man&rsquo;s boots, but they resisted all
his efforts. He took it good-humouredly and out of
humour, but with equally bad success, and at length
went on his way; but he could not make up his
mind to resign such a splendid piece of good fortune,
so he returned after he had gone a few steps,
and made another attempt.</p>

<p>The boots, however, remained immoveable, and
losing all patience, he exclaimed, &ldquo;Bad luck to
them!&rdquo; and taking out a large knife he carried with
him, cut off the legs just above the boots, thinking
that, more at his leisure, he would be able to clear
them out.</p>

<p>His plans were now altered, and instead of going<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
on to his friend, he returned to Katty&rsquo;s shed, carefully
carrying his new acquisition under his arm.</p>

<p>He found no difficulty in getting back into the
shed, but the difficulty of freeing the boots from the
feet and portion of the legs that remained in them
was increased rather than lessened; and at length
Paddy fell asleep over his unaccomplished task.
When he awoke day was already beginning to dawn,
and as he wanted to be early at a small town, some
six miles off, where there was to be a fair, he had no
time to lose; so he quickly got out of the shed, leaving
the boots behind him as useless&mdash;his friend Murphy&rsquo;s
feet pertinaciously keeping possession of them.</p>

<p>Not long after, Tim went to fetch him to breakfast,
to make up for the inhospitality of the previous
night; for with returning light the courage of the
family was restored, and, as is frequently the case
with weak minds, day gave an appearance of security
to that which night had shrouded in danger.</p>

<p>What was his surprise to see the shed occupied by
Katty alone; for he had found the door locked as
he had left it the night before, and yet Paddy was
nowhere to be seen.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span></p>

<p>He never once thought of the hole in the roof,
and was puzzled beyond measure. Paddy must be
somewhere; so he looked in all the four corners of
the shed, under the straw, and even under Katty herself,
who was comfortably lying down. He now
saw the boots, and was more puzzled than ever.
He scratched his head, as people will do when the
understanding is at fault, and during that process a
horrible light burst upon him.</p>

<p>He rushed out of the shed back to the kitchen,
where, to the amazement of all, he let himself fall
into old Goff&rsquo;s, just then, vacant chair, his mouth
open, his hair erect, and his eyes nearly starting
from his head.</p>

<p>All exclaimed with one voice, &ldquo;What in heaven&rsquo;s
name has happened! What is the matter with you,
Tim?&rdquo; After gasping several times for breath
Tim cried out, &ldquo;Och, the unnatural baste! Och,
the blood-thirsty cannibal! Poor Paddy! Och, the
murthering brute!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;In the name of all the saints tell us what has
happened!&rdquo; his Father said; and after a few more
incoherent sentences, Tim related how on going<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a><br /><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
into the shed he could not find the Piper, though he
could not have got out, for he had locked the door
the night before, and found it still locked; how
that, after looking all about, he had discovered the
boots, but that Katty had eaten up poor Paddy.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/ill39.jpg" width="397" height="522" alt="" />
<br /><span class="caption">Tim&rsquo;s Dismay at Katty&rsquo;s Cannibalism.</span>
</div>

<p>An exclamation of horror burst from all.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Every bit of him,&rdquo; Tim continued. &ldquo;The
blood-thirsty baste has eaten every bit of him. Not
a morsel of poor Paddy is left but the boots.&rdquo; The
rest were quite as much horrified as Tim himself,
and not a word was uttered till his Sister, who first
recovered something like self-possession, said, &ldquo;Let
us go and look once more, for it is almost too horrible
to believe that Katty could do such a thing;
she has always been such a good, gentle beast.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Och, the cannibal!&rdquo; Tim muttered, with a
shudder.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tim,&rdquo; old Goff said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve heard that a cannibal
is one man that eats another, and if so, perhaps
Katty is not a cannibal; but, mind me, I&rsquo;m not going
to defend the unnatural baste if she has eaten the
Piper. Did you say his pipes and all are gone?
Take care and don&rsquo;t go too near the crittur, but take<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
the pitchfork with you. Oh, that I should ever live
to hear the like!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Most unwillingly Tim went back to the shed; but
as his sister led the way he was ashamed to remain
behind. However, when they got there Katty began
bellowing with all her might, for she was unused to
being neglected, and felt herself ill used that Tim
should have been in without taking her her morning&rsquo;s
food, and now finding herself again disappointed,
she stared wildly at them.</p>

<p>Both started back, and Tim cried, &ldquo;See there,
how wicked she looks! Is that the baste you say is
so gentle? Sure she&rsquo;s dangerous, let&rsquo;s go back.&rdquo;
The sister ventured in and took the boots, which she
carried to the house.</p>

<p>These told the tale but too clearly, and poor Katty
had not a single voice raised in her favour. It was
now discussed what should be done with the animal,
for keeping her was out of the question. Who would
drink the milk of such a beast! Besides, it was dangerous
to go near her; and it was therefore settled that
Tim should take her to the fair, which fortunately
was held that very day, and sell her at any price.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span></p>

<p>Suddenly they were startled by a loud bellowing
from the shed, for during this time no one had
thought of feeding the poor beast, and the next
moment all were seized with the utmost consternation,
for Katty appeared at the shed door and walked
straight up towards the house.</p>

<p>The kitchen was now a scene of the wildest
confusion, for in their eagerness to seize upon any
article of furniture that might serve as a weapon of
defence, they rushed against each other; but Katty
stopped at some fresh grass that was in a cart near
the house, which indeed had attracted her. As
soon, however, as she had taken the edge off her
morning appetite she went to the window, for she
was a sociable beast, and had always been accustomed
to be noticed; but all the inmates of the kitchen
were huddled together at the further end, and their
terror is indescribable when she pushed the window
open, for it had not been properly fastened.</p>

<p>She, however, stood so quiet, and looked so gentle
and mild, that after a time old Goff mustered courage
to say, &ldquo;Now that she has filled herself with grass
she will perhaps not bite, so now is the time to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
secure her. Take the rope that is hanging up there,
Tim, make a noose, and slip it quickly over her
nose.&rdquo; As Tim hesitated, his Sister said, &ldquo;I will go
with you;&rdquo; and then he did as he was directed, till,
as he was about to slip the rope over her nose, she
opened her mouth, thinking it was something for
her to eat.</p>

<p>Tim started back so suddenly that, losing his balance,
he fell flat upon the floor, shouting for help,
but his sister, catching hold of the rope, put it round
Katty&rsquo;s nose; and when Tim saw that there was no
danger he finished the work for her, tying the rope
at least half-a-dozen times round the unresisting
creature&rsquo;s jaws. Nothing now remained to be done
but for Tim to get on his Sunday clothes, which did
not take long, and poor Katty was led off, receiving
much rougher treatment than she had been accustomed
to.</p>

<p>For a time Tim and Katty had the road to themselves,
and were not over-pleasant companions, for
to poor Katty all seemed strange; besides that she
received many a blow from her guide, who was in
anything but a good humour; and when they were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
joined by any one it made it none the more pleasant
for Tim, who now found out all the difficulties he
had to contend with, for he was not prepared with
an answer when asked what was the reason why
Katty was to be sold, or why her mouth was fastened
up so. What could he answer, for, as he said to
himself, &ldquo;If I tell the truth who would buy the unnatural
baste? And I won&rsquo;t let the people think we
want money.&rdquo; His pride revolted at this; but it was
evident he must be prepared with a more satisfactory
answer than he had hitherto given, namely,
that he did not know why his father intended to
part with his cow, for he heard two farmers, who
had lately joined the others, talking thus together.</p>

<p>The one said, &ldquo;Why, that is old Goff&rsquo;s favourite
cow, sure it can&rsquo;t be it&rsquo;s selling her he is, for I heard
that he was offered twelve pounds for her no longer
than a fortnight ago, but he wouldn&rsquo;t sell her at any
price.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;May be it&rsquo;s gone dry she is,&rdquo; said the other.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, she doesn&rsquo;t look like that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then it&rsquo;s money he wants. May be the rint
isn&rsquo;t paid, and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;No, it&rsquo;s not that,&rdquo; the first speaker interrupted
him, &ldquo;for old Goff is too close an old fist not to
have plenty of money; but mark me, Neighbour,
there&rsquo;s something wrong with her, sleek and fresh as
she looks, and it isn&rsquo;t I that would be buying her at
any price.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Poor Tim was sadly puzzled, for it was impossible
he could escape being asked all manner of questions,
and he knew no more than his heels what to say.
Then, too, he feared that no one would have her,
and what should he do with her then. His worst
fears were soon to be realized, for a new comer, who
had heard the end of the conversation of the last two
speakers, now said to him&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, Tim, and what has the darling of your
house done that you want to sell her? Is it fits she
has, for there is something wild in her eye? Or it&rsquo;s
vicious she is? Speak, Man, what is the matter with
her?&rdquo;</p>

<p>To avoid unpleasant questions, Tim said, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
too much trouble to my sister to attend to her, for
it&rsquo;s my sister&rsquo;s cow she is.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And is it washing her face of a morning that&rsquo;s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
too much trouble to your sister?&rdquo; Tim was now
asked; &ldquo;or perhaps combing her hair is troublesome,
or may be it&rsquo;s cutting her corns your sister
doesn&rsquo;t like; but come, Tim, that won&rsquo;t do, Man, for
why is Katty more trouble than the other cows?
Let me look at her, that I may see what ails her.&rdquo;
He examined her all over; and, to Tim&rsquo;s horror,
taking the rope from round her nose, looked into
her mouth, but he could not discover one single
fault in her, which only excited his suspicion the
more. &ldquo;May be you&rsquo;d take five pounds for her?&rdquo;
And, as Tim eagerly assented, he continued, &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll
take five pounds for her, and your father just a day
or two ago refused twelve. There&rsquo;s something in
all this I can&rsquo;t make out, so go on with her, for I&rsquo;ll
none of her. I&rsquo;m not going to be tricked by you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tim was now in utter despair. He saw plainly
he must say that it was money they wanted. But
would even that do, for his father had other cows,
and why sell the one which everybody knew was
the favourite? His only chance was to get rid of her
to some one who did not know him, and he therefore
hurried her on to the market.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span></p>

<p>The market was very full, and, when he found
himself surrounded by strange faces, he felt more at
ease; however, no purchaser was found, and Tim
began to feel not only impatient, but seriously uneasy,
for Katty looked about her in a very suspicious
manner, and he dreaded the consequences
should she grow very hungry. He shuddered as he
thought of the fate of poor Paddy, and, oh horror!
just then he thought he saw Paddy himself in the
distance. He could not take his eyes from the spot
where he had seen the horrid apparition, though he
trembled at the possibility of its reappearance.</p>

<p>There it was again, beckoning to him.</p>

<p>This was more than poor Tim could bear, and he
rushed wildly out of the market, down the nearest
turning, and out of the town. On he ran, not knowing
where, pursued in imagination by poor Paddy&rsquo;s
ghost, till out of breath, when he ventured to look
back. He could run no more, for he was now
transfixed to the spot by horror. Katty, with her
mouth open, came full gallop after him, and quicker
than the wind followed Paddy&rsquo;s ghost. He stood<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
motionless till they were close upon him, and then
fell senseless to the ground.</p>

<p>When he recovered he found Paddy holding a
pocket flask of whisky to his lips, whilst Katty was
looking at him with the mildest expression of concern.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What were you doing in the market with Katty?
And what, in heaven&rsquo;s name, induced you to run
away as if possessed by a thousand devils?&rdquo; Paddy
said. &ldquo;What does all this mean, Tim? Have you
gone clean mad?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And is it you, Paddy?&rdquo; Tim asked; &ldquo;or is it
your ghost? For if it&rsquo;s your ghost I beg your honor
ten thousand pardons for all the trouble I&rsquo;ve given
you, in making your honor run after me so far.
And I beg your honor to forgive my auld father and
mother, and my dear sister, and to forgive me too.
And I humbly beg your honor will not haunt us, for
it will be the bodily death of us all; but if we can
do anything to give your blessid soul rest, tell me
what it is and it shall be done. Where shall we
bury your blessid feet? It was not our fault that this
blood-thirsty baste, bad luck to it, ate you up last<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
night, all but your honor&rsquo;s feet, bless them. Directly
we found out the misfortune that had happened to
your honor, for I went early to fetch you to the most
iligant breakfast my mother could get ready, we all
settled that the cannibal brute should no longer
be one of our family, and I brought her to the
market to sell. This is every word the blessid truth.
So I beg your honor to forgive us, and may your
soul rest in peace!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Stop,&rdquo; Paddy cried, &ldquo;or yer&rsquo;ll be the rale death
o&rsquo; me.&rdquo; It was now Paddy&rsquo;s turn to fall, and he
rolled about on the ground convulsed with laughter,
for he now saw what a mistake Murphy&rsquo;s boots had
led to. When he had recovered himself enough to
be able to speak, he told Tim how all had happened,
and advised him to take Katty home again
directly, which he did, and Katty became even a
greater favourite with the whole family than ever
she had been.</p>

<p class="stl1">The Three Men of Gotham on Nottingham Bridge.</p>


<div class="figleft">
<img src="images/ill-y.jpg" width="71" height="77" alt="Y" title="Y" />
</div>

<p class="cap"><span class="upper">You,</span> of course, know that the good people
of Gotham have been particularly noted
for their wisdom; but if, by chance, this
should not form one of the items of your
varied knowledge, the stories I am about to relate
will leave no doubt on your minds as to the justice
of the report.</p>

<p>Whether it may be something in the air that has
made these people so peculiarly gifted I cannot tell,
for I must confess that I have never been at Gotham,
and know absolutely nothing of the geological properties
of the soil, or indeed of the neighbourhood
in any way, excepting that Nottingham is the principal
city of that part of the country.</p>

<p>You probably know, as well as I can tell you,
what Nottingham is noted for, so I will say nothing
about it, particularly as what I might and could say<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
would in no way help us in clearing up the mystery,
namely, why the inhabitants of one particular place
should be mentally gifted beyond others. If, indeed,
we were considering Nottingham itself I might attempt
some sort of an explanation, by telling you
that a great part of the business of the town being
shoemaking would perhaps account for a contemplative
turn of its citizens, for shoemakers are
supposed to be men of deep thought. Why this
should be so is another mystery requiring to be
cleared up, which I will leave to others to do, and
only just remark, that there can be no doubt several
cases of men of thought and talent among that class
might be cited. I will only mention the German
shoemaker, of whom perhaps you have heard, who
wrote up over his shop,&mdash;</p>

<div class="centered"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0a">&ldquo;Hans Saxs shoe<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Maker and poet too.&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p class="noi">That&rsquo;s not bad, particularly for a German.</p>

<p>But to return to Gotham, with which a consideration
of Nottingham has nothing to do. We all
know particular individuals who are shining stars,
and even families of stars we know, but still that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
does not tell us how and why there should be a
whole community of such extraordinary lights. We
have confessed our inability to explain this in the
case of Gotham, and therefore let us take a liberal
view of the matter, and suppose that from generation
to generation the children inherited from their
parents such a happy development of brain, that it
was utterly impossible they could be anything but
wise. It might be worth a phrenologist&rsquo;s while to
go down there. But mind, I am only speaking of
what the people of Gotham were, for, as I said, I
know, personally, nothing of the place, and at the
present day all may be materially altered.</p>

<p>I cannot tell you exactly when it happened, but
on a certain day, in a certain year, two men of
Gotham met on Nottingham bridge. &ldquo;Well met,
Neighbour,&rdquo; said the one man, &ldquo;whither are you
going?&rdquo; &ldquo;I have just come from the market at
Nottingham, and am going home to fetch my wife
and child, whom I forgot,&rdquo; was the answer; &ldquo;and
pray where are you going, Neighbour?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to the market at Nottingham to buy
sheep,&rdquo; said the first man.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;And which way do you intend to bring the
sheep home?&rdquo; asked the man who had come from
Nottingham.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Over this bridge,&rdquo; answered he who was going
thither.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But you cannot,&rdquo; said the one.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But I must,&rdquo; said the other.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But you shall not, Neighbour,&rdquo; said the man
who was on his way home to fetch his wife and
child.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And why shall I not, Neighbour?&rdquo; asked he
who was going to Nottingham to buy sheep.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You see,&rdquo; said the one, &ldquo;that there is not room
for my wife and child to pass, so keep them back,
Man.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I care not,&rdquo; said the other, &ldquo;my sheep shall
pass, so let your wife and child stand back.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They shall not pass.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But they shall pass.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Woo! Woo! back there,&rdquo; shouted the one man,
spreading out his arms and legs, as is done to keep
sheep back.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Woo! Woo! get on there,&rdquo; shouted the other,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
flourishing his stick, and striking the ground first on
one side and then on the other.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Take care, or you will drive them over my
wife. But if she is hurt you shall pay the doctor&rsquo;s
bill.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will not pay the doctor&rsquo;s bill. But you take
care, for if you make my sheep jump over the side
of the bridge and they are drowned you shall pay for
them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will not pay for them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But you must pay for them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Whilst this dispute was going on another man of
Gotham had ridden up, with a sack of meal behind
him on his donkey, and hearing the quarrel between
his neighbours about the one&rsquo;s wife, whom he had
just seen safe at home, and about the other&rsquo;s sheep,
when there were no sheep there, he got off his
donkey and called to the two disputants to lift the sack
of meal upon his shoulders. When they had done so,
first untying the mouth of the sack, he emptied the
meal over the side of the bridge into the river. Then,
holding up the sack with the mouth down, before
his astonished neighbours, he said,&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a><br /><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Will you tell me how much meal there is in
this sack?&rdquo;</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/ill40.jpg" width="392" height="518" alt="" />
<br /><span class="caption">The Three Wise Gothamites.</span>
</div>

<p>&ldquo;Why, none,&rdquo; both said, &ldquo;since you have just
emptied it out.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he answered, &ldquo;just so much wit is in
your two heads when you dispute about wife and
sheep, and neither wife nor sheep are here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Now which was the wisest of the three?</p>

<p class="stl1">The Man of Gotham and his Cheeses.</p>


<div class="figleft">
<img src="images/ill-o1.jpg" width="71" height="75" alt="O" title="O" />
</div>

<p class="cap"><span class="upper">One</span> hot summer&rsquo;s day a man of Gotham
was on his way to Nottingham market
to sell his cheeses, which he carried in a
bag slung across his shoulder. He found
the heat oppressive, and his load so troublesome, that
he could not help bewailing his lot in the following
words&mdash;&ldquo;Unfortunate man that I am, why have I
not a cart like neighbour Dobbins, or even a barrow
like old Mathews? My good woman will make so
many cheeses that I have no rest any market day.
But now I have it; she is a shrewd woman, and I
will propose to her to make the cheeses so that they
can walk to market, and then I need only walk by
the side of them, to see that they do not loiter or
play by the way. I wonder she never thought of
that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This bright idea consoled him and made him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
forget even his load for a time, but it weighed so
heavily upon him that he was soon recalled to his
misfortunes, and as he trudged along he constantly
changed the bag from one shoulder to the other.
Now with these frequent changes the mouth of the
bag had got loose, and just as he reached the top of
the hill, looking down upon the bridge and Nottingham
in the distance, one of the cheeses fell out and
rolled down the hill.</p>

<p>He watched it for a time, and as it kept so well
to the road, neither turning to one side nor the
other, but jumping over the stones that lay in its
way, he exclaimed in delight, &ldquo;Well done, well
done, keep on like that, my good friend, and you&rsquo;ll
soon be at your journey&rsquo;s end! It was foolish of my
old woman not to tell me that they could run by
themselves, but now that I have found it out, I&rsquo;m
not going to carry the lazy things a step farther.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Having come to this wise resolution he bundled
the cheeses out of the bag, and, as they rolled down
the hill, cried after them, &ldquo;There, follow your companion;
but you need not run so fast, for I shall rest
myself a bit and then walk leisurely after you. Now,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a><br /><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
mind you all meet me in the market-place.&rdquo; He
watched them with the greatest satisfaction as they
ran down the hill and over the bridge, when, the
road turning suddenly, they were lost to his sight;
and then, too, they all left the road, some running
into one bush and some into another, whilst the rest
got no further than the ditch by the roadside.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/ill41.jpg" width="395" height="522" alt="" />
<br /><span class="caption">The Gothamite and his Cheeses.</span>
</div>

<p>After a short rest the worthy man went on his way
to Nottingham, without troubling his mind about the
cheeses, as he fully expected to find them waiting
for him in the market-place; but when he got there
he was somewhat astonished to find that they had
not yet arrived. &ldquo;No doubt,&rdquo; he said to himself,
&ldquo;as soon as they were out of my sight they got to
some of their games in some field or another. That
is always the way, but they&rsquo;ll be here soon.&rdquo; When,
however, the market time was nearly over, and the
cheeses had not appeared, he inquired of the market
people whether they had seen them. No one had
seen his cheeses, and when he was asked who brought
them he said,&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No one brought them. Sure they were quite
able to come by themselves, as you would say if you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
had seen them running along the road; but now I
think of it, they were going at such a rate that they
are no doubt half way on their road to York by
now.&rdquo; So he hired a horse and rode off towards
York to try and overtake them, but strange to say he
did not overtake them, nor indeed did he ever see
them again, nor hear any tidings of them.</p>

<p class="stl1">Twelve Men of Gotham go out Fishing together.</p>


<div class="figleft">
<img src="images/ill-t2.jpg" width="71" height="76" alt="T" title="T" />
</div>

<p class="cap"><span class="upper">Twelve</span> men of Gotham settled to go
out fishing together; and, as the anticipation
of pleasure is nearly worth the pleasure
itself, they fixed the time a fortnight
off, and each day during the interval made some
preparation for the great day. The appointed day
came in due time, and it was cold and drizzling;
but the twelve met, for what true sportsman would
allow weather to stop him? They were all in the
highest spirits, and their conversation was of the
wittiest and most brilliant description, as you will
judge it must have been when you know more of
the men. I do not attempt to give it you here,
being well aware that I could not possibly do it
justice.</p>

<p>When they got to the river-side, after a lengthy
consultation, they settled that the fish would feel shy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
of coming to them, seeing so many together; and it
was therefore agreed they should separate, all to
meet again at the same place in five hours&rsquo; time.
After they had fairly divided their provisions into
twelve parts, each took his share, and went whither
his fancy guided him.</p>

<p>Exact to the time, the twelve again assembled
together, and adjourned to a tavern, where it had
been arranged the day should be finished in conviviality.
They were cold and wet to the skin, but
all declared they had had a delightful day, each reserving
his adventures till they were comfortably
seated together.</p>

<p>Most extraordinary adventures they had all had;
for one related how, immediately that he had thrown
his line, well baited with a worm, he hooked the
most wonderful fish he had ever seen; for though
it only appeared on the top of the water for a moment
at a time, he could plainly discover that it was
hairy, and had a long tail. He had given the creature
line enough to play, but, when he had followed
it more than a mile, the line unfortunately broke&mdash;for
the beast was strong, being quite as large as a
cat.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;That is extraordinary,&rdquo; another then cried, &ldquo;for
I, too, followed a hairy fish, such as I never saw before.
You must know, as I went along looking for
a likely spot, I frightened the creature from the
bank, and it swam across the river. As quick as
possible, I threw my worm just before its nose, but
it would not bite, so, like a shot, I was in the water,
and waded across after it. It took refuge in a hole,
and when I put in my hand to catch it, it bit me so
that I have not been able to use that hand all day,
and no doubt that is the reason I have not hooked a
single fish. The beast appeared, for all the world,
like a rat.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A third then told his companions how he had
wandered along the side of a river till he came to a
mill, where, by the bubbles under the wheel, he
could see that the water was swarming with fish.
He threw in his bait, and almost immediately had a
bite. He felt convinced that he must have hooked
several large fish at the same time, for no single one
could have pulled the line with such force. The
line was strong, so that it did not break, and at length
the rod itself was fairly dragged out of his hands,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
and for a moment disappeared under the water.
The fish, however, must have broken away, for the
rod appeared again entangled in the wheel, and was
whirled round till it was dashed to pieces. Finishing
the account of his startling adventure, he said,
&ldquo;I am sure, my Friends, that at that spot there will
be plenty of sport for the whole twelve of us together;
and had it not been for that unlucky accident
of losing my rod, I should have brought fish
enough for all our suppers.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Various were the adventures narrated, several of
them having narrowly escaped drowning, as they
said&mdash;only that the water was not deep enough.
Amongst the whole twelve only one fish was produced&mdash;a
small one, which its fortunate captor had
found floating, dead, upon the water.</p>

<p>When the last of the twelve had finished his account,
he said, &ldquo;I am sure, my good Friends and
Neighbours, that no twelve men ever had such an
extraordinary day&rsquo;s fishing as we have had; and, had
we not met with these unfortunate accidents, we
should have brought home such strange fish, and in
such quantities, that the account of our day&rsquo;s sport<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
would have been inserted in all the newspapers.
But, my dear Brethren, we have been in many great
dangers, and I shudder when I think of it, that perhaps
one of us has been drowned. Let us count,
and see whether the whole twelve of us are safely
here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, let us count!&rdquo; all exclaimed; &ldquo;for perhaps
one of our dear brothers is drowned, and what will
his unfortunate widow do?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Each of the twelve counted in turn, and each only
counted eleven, omitting himself; and then all cried
out, &ldquo;It is but too true that one of our dear brothers
is lost! Who shall carry the sad news to his widow?
But first let us go back to the river, and look for the
body.&rdquo;</p>

<p>These twelve wise men went down to the river,
and searched every place where, during the day,
either of them had been, but no body was found,
which they bitterly bewailed, as it was deprived of
Christian burial. They then drew lots which of
them should inform the unfortunate widow of her
dreadful loss; and when he on whom the lot fell inquired
of the others to whose widow he should go,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a><br /><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
and no one could tell him, they bewailed still more
bitterly that they could not discover which of their
dear brothers was lost.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/ill42.jpg" width="394" height="519" alt="" />
<br /><span class="caption">The Lost Fisherman found.</span>
</div>

<p>It happened that at this time a gentleman from
the Court was passing, and seeing them in such distress,
asked the cause.</p>

<p>They said, &ldquo;This morning twelve of us came
down to the river to fish, and one is missing, whom
we cannot find.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then the Gentleman said, &ldquo;What will you give
me if I find your missing companion?&rdquo; To which
they answered, that they would gladly give all the
money they had if he could restore their lost brother
to them.</p>

<p>He then made them stand in a row, and riding
along the back of them gave each such a smart cut
with his whip that they cried aloud with pain, and
as they did so he numbered them; but when he came
to the twelfth he thrashed him till he and all his
companions cried out for mercy for him; and the
Gentleman said, &ldquo;This is the twelfth of you!&rdquo; whereupon
they thanked him for restoring their lost brother
to them.</p>

<p class="stl1">The Cobbler&rsquo;s Wager.</p>


<div class="figleft">
<img src="images/ill-o2.jpg" width="72" height="76" alt="O" title="O" />
</div>

<p class="cap"><span class="upper">One</span> fine summer&rsquo;s day a strong, active
young man was sauntering along the
Exeter road, with apparently no immediate
object in view but to pass away the
time, for he certainly seemed in no hurry to reach
the place of his destination&mdash;if, indeed, such a thing
was in his thoughts, as it undoubtedly should have
been, for he was carrying home a pair of shoes he
had taken the greater part of the week to mend.</p>

<p>You will guess by this that he was a cobbler by
trade, and from the way he was going on we may,
perhaps, form an idea how it is that cobblers are
proverbially so little to be depended upon in the performance
of a promise&mdash;at least, when that promise
refers to their work.</p>

<p>The young man we are talking of was not fond
of work, but, being a merry, jovial fellow, was much<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
liked in the neighbourhood where he lived, more particularly
as he was always ready to give a helping
hand to any one who required the assistance of a
strong arm, and never hesitated to neglect his own
business to help others.</p>

<p>Perhaps, too, that sort of occupation was more
profitable than mending boots and shoes, for he
always seemed to have money to spare when he met
any companions of his own stamp at the different
road-side inns. He was now coming near to such a
house, and was trying to find a good excuse to turn
in&mdash;for the landlord, according to his words, was a
man of the right sort&mdash;when a butcher, in his cart,
carrying a calf he had just bought, whom he knew
well, overtook him.</p>

<p>No excuse was, of course, required now to drop
in at Tom Turner&rsquo;s, the landlord just mentioned,
if even he had not been standing at his door, where,
however, he was, ready to welcome them.</p>

<p>The three were soon merry enough over a jug of
foaming ale; and the butcher, in particular, was in
high spirits, for he had not only made a good bargain,
but one he prided himself upon. The Landlord<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
said to him, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;ve been playing
your pranks off on some one, or that you&rsquo;ve overreached
some poor wretch in a bargain, makes you
in such high glee this morning.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ve not done so badly, I think,&rdquo; the
Butcher answered, rubbing his hands. &ldquo;A little
mother&rsquo;s wit in one&rsquo;s head is worth having, and
where&rsquo;s the good if one doesn&rsquo;t use it? You must
know I particularly wanted a calf this morning&mdash;indeed,
I couldn&rsquo;t do without it, whatever price I
had to give; and as I happened to hear yesterday
that old farmer Hagan had some very fine ones, I
went to him. Now I didn&rsquo;t tell him that I wanted
a calf&mdash;leave me alone for that&mdash;but I said I wanted
some sheep, which I knew he just happened not to
have. He told me that he hadn&rsquo;t any, and, as I expected,
then said he had some first-rate calves which
he wished me to see.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I am very sorry to hear it, Neighbour,&rsquo; I said;
&lsquo;for calves are falling down to nothing in value
since the celebrated Doctor Tweedle came into
these parts. You know that he has declared veal
to be the most unwholesome meat there is, and that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
eating it is little short of eating poison; so that no
one will touch it. I have two of the most beautiful
calves you ever saw, which I am but too happy to
be able to get rid of at thirty shillings each&mdash;just
half what I gave for them. A friend of mine has
occasion for three, which he is going to send off to
a distance; so I am glad to be able to do you a good
turn, if you are willing to part with one of yours on
the same terms; but it must be a good &rsquo;un.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Old Hagan was loath to part with one of his
calves at such a price, but was so frightened by what
I had told him, that he let me have the one that is
outside in my cart, saying, &lsquo;I know, Neighbour,
that you are not a man likely to be over-reached,
and that you would not sell at such a price if you
saw a chance of getting a better one.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; the Butcher continued, &ldquo;does either of
you think he could make as good a bargain as that?&rdquo;
And he chuckled, again rubbing his hands, as they
both confessed that they gave in to him.</p>

<p>Shortly after, the cobbler rose to go, saying, as
the butcher offered to give him a lift in his cart,
that he was going another way; and as he went out,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
he made a sign to the landlord to follow him.
When they were outside together he whispered, &ldquo;I
should like to play our boasting friend a good trick.&rdquo;
&ldquo;I wish, with all my heart, you could,&rdquo; the Landlord
answered; &ldquo;but he is a cunning fellow.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Cunning as he is, I&rsquo;ve a great mind to steal the
calf he&rsquo;s so proud of having cheated old Hagan out
of, and then sell it him again, but at double the
price,&rdquo; the Cobbler said. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s too deep for you,&rdquo;
said the Landlord; &ldquo;you can&rsquo;t do it.&rdquo; &ldquo;What
will you bet?&rdquo; the Cobbler asked. &ldquo;Anything you
like!&rdquo; was the answer. &ldquo;Well, then,&rdquo; the Cobbler
again said, &ldquo;let it be a gallon of your very best ale.
Now you go back, and manage&mdash;as if without any
particular motive&mdash;to tell our friend that you have
a calf (that can be easily done as he is getting into
his cart), when you may as well say that it is just like
the one he has. You do this, and leave the rest
to me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I hope, with all my heart, that you&rsquo;ll succeed,&rdquo;
the Landlord said, as he went back into the house;
and the cobbler hastened along the road which he
knew was the butcher&rsquo;s way. When he had got<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
some distance from the house, he dropped one of
the shoes he was carrying home by the side of the
road, where it would be sure to be seen, and then
ran on some distance further, where he dropped the
other shoe, choosing the spot close by an opening in
the hedge by the road-side.</p>

<p>Shortly after, the butcher came the same way,
still chuckling over his morning&rsquo;s bargain, and when
he saw the shoe, drew in his horse. He was about
to get out, when he thought better of it, saying,
&ldquo;There&rsquo;s some of that careless cobbler&rsquo;s work. He
evidently has come this way, and dropped one of the
shoes I saw him carrying&mdash;but I&rsquo;m not going to
take the trouble to carry it after him. Let him come
back, and that will teach him not to refuse a civil
offer again. If he had but dropped the pair, I
should not mind getting out to pick them up&mdash;though
certainly it would not be to give them to
him, but to keep them myself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>With these friendly thoughts he drove on, and, before
long, saw the other shoe. &ldquo;Hallo!&rdquo; he said;
&ldquo;why, that lazy rascal of a cobbler, rather than go
back when he discovered the loss of the one shoe,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
has thrown the other away as useless; but I&rsquo;ll not be
such a fool, and won&rsquo;t begrudge a little trouble for the
sake of a good pair of shoes.&rdquo; So saying, he jumped
out of his cart and picked up the shoe, and, finding
it was a good one, ran back for the other, leaving
his cart standing in the road.</p>

<p>No sooner had he turned a corner in the road,
than the cobbler jumped out from behind the hedge
where he had hidden himself, and having lifted the
calf out of the cart, took it on his shoulders, and
hurried back with his load, as fast as possible, a
short cut to Tom Turner&rsquo;s house.</p>

<p>Tom received him with an acclamation of joy;
and as soon as they had stowed the calf away in a shed,
he produced some of his very best ale, over which
they discussed what was further to be done. The
Cobbler said, &ldquo;As soon as the butcher finds that
his calf has disappeared, and that there are no signs
of it, he will be sure to come back to you, having
heard you had one; but be sure you do not let him
have it a farthing under three pounds, for you
know that was the price named by himself, and
that he said he must have one to-day at any price.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
When we have had our joke out, we will give him
back his money, making him pay the amount of our
wager, and another gallon to boot. But he is a
slippery rogue, so mind you do not part with the
calf without receiving the money down. And now,
what will you bet that I do not steal this very calf
again?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The landlord, enjoying the joke, betted another
gallon, and his companion continued, &ldquo;To prepare
for another sale, tell him, as he is driving off&mdash;tell
him you have another calf, the twin brother to this
one, and so like it that no one can tell one from the
other.&rdquo;</p>

<p>After all that had been arranged, the cobbler related
every circumstance of the past adventure&mdash;not
forgetting the butcher&rsquo;s soliloquy&mdash;to Tom&rsquo;s infinite
amusement, and added, &ldquo;Take particular notice
whether he says anything about finding the shoes;
for if he intends to act dishonestly we may alter our
determination about giving him back his money.&rdquo;
He had scarcely finished when they saw the butcher&rsquo;s
cart at the door, so he hastened away to his former
hiding-place.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span></p>

<p>The next moment the butcher was in the house,
and he cried out, &ldquo;Tom! you must positively let
me have that calf of yours, for mine has played me
an infernal trick, and has run off! I saw the brute,
and ran after it. But it doesn&rsquo;t matter, for I know
where it is, and can easily catch it again. But I&rsquo;m
in a hurry, so I thought it better to come back for
yours.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How did it happen?&rdquo; Tom asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, my horse got a stone in its hoof, and as I
had to go a few yards off to get a dry stick to pick
it out with, the brute took advantage of my being
away, jumped out of the cart and got into a field by
the side of the road. When I got back, though I
saw it, it had the start of me, and I was not inclined
to run far after it. But, now, I&rsquo;m in a hurry; so
tell me at once, Tom, what you want for your
calf.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tom answered, &ldquo;You know that I do not quite
believe in veal being poison, in spite of the great
Doctor&rsquo;s opinion; but, to accommodate a friend, I
don&rsquo;t mind parting with it cheap, though I really
can&rsquo;t take less than three pounds.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span></p>

<p>The butcher, finding that his own words were
used against him, made no difficulty, but, paying the
money, carried off the calf, Tom calling after him
that if he lost that he had his twin brother for him.
He congratulated himself, as he drove along, that,
though he paid dearly for the calf, he had, at least,
got a good pair of shoes for nothing. To make up
for lost time he put his horse to its best trot, but drew
in suddenly when he got to the spot of his misfortune,
for he heard a sound like the bleating of a
calf. He listened for a moment, and then exclaimed,
in glee, &ldquo;Oh! it&rsquo;s you is it, my runaway? Now,
take my word for it, you shall suffer for this.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He jumped out of the cart and got into the field,
but the bleating seemed to proceed from the next
field, and when he got there from another, till he
was led on to a considerable distance from his cart.</p>

<p>The cobbler, who had imitated the bleating of a
calf, when he had led on the butcher till he got confused,
hurried back to where the cart was, and hastily
taking out the calf, got safely back with it to
Tom Turner&rsquo;s.</p>

<p>Tom, who had scarcely expected success this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
time, was fit to split his sides with laughter, when
he heard an account of this last adventure, and in his
turn told what had passed between him and the
butcher.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, the rascal!&rdquo; exclaimed the Cobbler, who
was a honest fellow himself, &ldquo;so he intends to
steal the shoes, for he knows well enough that they
belong to me. We&rsquo;ll give him another chance when
he comes back, for I&rsquo;ll tell him that I lost the shoes;
but if then he does not restore them, why I&rsquo;ll sell
them to him for his calf and the money we get out
of him. Don&rsquo;t you think it will serve him right?&rdquo;
The landlord agreed, that if he persisted in dishonestly
keeping the shoes, he would deserve to pay
dearly for them, adding,&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If we could manage it, it would be well to let
him have his calf this time for nothing.&rdquo; But the
Cobbler, who was very indignant at the fellow&rsquo;s
shuffling dishonesty, said, &ldquo;No, no, he deserves no
manner of consideration, but I hope he won&rsquo;t prove
quite as bad as I think him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The butcher soon returned, and this time told the
truth of the manner in which he had lost the calf;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
but when the cobbler told him of his loss he was far
from confessing that he had found the shoes, and
that they were then in his cart, hidden under some
straw. He was out of humour at his own losses,
and said, rather brutally, &ldquo;You are so careless that
your loss serves you right. What is your loss to
mine? I have now paid four pounds ten for a calf,
and still haven&rsquo;t got one for my customers. Come,
Tom, my good Friend, you must be merciful this
time, and let me have your other calf a little cheaper.
If you&rsquo;ll let me have it for two pounds here&rsquo;s the
money, but if not I must go back to old Hagan&rsquo;s
for one.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Whilst this bargain was being concluded the
cobbler went out, and looking in the butcher&rsquo;s cart
soon found the shoes, which he took, replacing the
straw as he found it.</p>

<p>Tom accepted the two pounds that were offered
him, and the butcher was this time allowed to get
his dearly-bought calf safely home; but I&rsquo;m sorry
to say the owner of the shoes had to wait another
day for them, as the cobbler spent the remainder of
that one with his friend, and merrily they spent it.</p>

<p class="stl1">The Miller and his Donkey.</p>


<div class="figleft">
<img src="images/ill-t3.jpg" width="71" height="76" alt="T" title="T" />
</div>

<p class="cap"><span class="upper">There</span> was a miller, never mind in what
part of the country, who had a tall,
gawky son; but their combined wit had
not proved sufficient to keep their business
in a flourishing condition, for the poor man got
poorer and poorer, selling one thing after another
that was not absolutely required to keep the mill
going, when, indeed, there was work for it to do,
till the turn came for the donkey to be sold.</p>

<p>This donkey had been a faithful servant to the
miller, who looked upon it as a friend, and being a
kind feeling man, it was with a heavy heart he made
up his mind to take it to the fair to sell&mdash;but there
is no resisting necessity.</p>

<p>On the day of the fair, having some distance to
go, he started early, and took his son with him, that
they might both see the last of their friend.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span></p>

<p>The donkey walked on in front, thoughtfully and
demurely, as donkeys are wont to do, whilst the
father and son followed sorrowfully. They soon got
into the high road, which was crowded with people
going to the fair, and the two poor simple fellows
soon became the butt of the different wits. &ldquo;That
is a hopeful son of yours,&rdquo; one would say to the
father; &ldquo;you must feel proud of him I should think.&rdquo;
And another would say to the son, pointing with his
thumb to his father, &ldquo;The old &rsquo;un looks a tartar;
does he whip you much?&rdquo; Many of the like remarks
we made to father and son, loud enough to
be heard by both, though pretended to be in a whisper;
but the principal shafts were shot at them in
conversations carried on round about, not a word
of which could they fail to hear.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you ever see such an old fool as that,&rdquo; said
one, &ldquo;to be walking along this hot road, and his
donkey going on in front with nothing to carry?&rdquo;
&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; another said, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s the donkey behind, for
he in front is much the wiser of the two.&rdquo; &ldquo;I
wonder,&rdquo; another joined in, &ldquo;the old fellow doesn&rsquo;t
take more care of himself at his time of life, if not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
for his own sake, at least for his baby&rsquo;s, for what
would become of the poor child if anything were to
happen to him?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Stung by these remarks the old man got on to the
donkey, though he regretted giving the poor beast
such a load to carry, and he sought to lighten it by
partly walking, for his long legs easily reached the
ground. This made matters worse, for he soon
heard one of his tormentors say, &ldquo;Look there, was
there ever such an old brute? He&rsquo;s taking it easy,
and lets his poor boy toil along as best he can. Such
an interesting child, too! Oh, if its mother did but
know how cruelly her darling child is being treated.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Hearing this the miller made his son take his
place, and wondered, as he walked by his side,
whether he was now doing right.</p>

<p>He was as far from it as ever, poor man, for he
very shortly heard an exclamation, and this time
from an old man, whose opinion should carry some
weight. &ldquo;Well, this is too bad; what will the
world come to next? Here&rsquo;s a big lout of a fellow
riding whilst his old father&rsquo;s walking. It&rsquo;s disgraceful,
that it is, for if even the fellow&rsquo;s lame, at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a><br /><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
any rate he should make room for the old man.
The donkey&rsquo;s strong enough to carry the two.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/ill44.jpg" width="393" height="519" alt="" />
<br /><span class="caption">The Burdened Beast.</span>
</div>

<p>Now the miller got on the donkey in front of
his son, to whom he whispered not to weigh too
heavily on the poor beast&rsquo;s back, and they got on for
some distance in peace. But it was not to last long,
for when the donkey happened to stumble, from
kicking against a stone, there was a general outcry:
&ldquo;They want to kill the poor beast. Is there no one
to interfere? But it&rsquo;s one comfort that cruelty to
animals can be punished. Who&rsquo;ll inform against
these two big brutes? Why either of them is strong
enough to carry the poor little thing, instead of
breaking its back, as they are doing with their
weight.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;When shall we do what&rsquo;s right?&rdquo; said the poor
Miller. &ldquo;Get off, my Son, and so will I, and we&rsquo;ll
carry the donkey between us. Surely then we shall
not be blamed.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/ill45.jpg" width="391" height="520" alt="" />
<br /><span class="caption">The Beast a Burden.</span>
</div>

<p>Having borrowed a strong pole, they tied the
donkey&rsquo;s four legs to it, and each taking an end of
the pole across his shoulder, they managed, though
with great difficulty, to carry it; but it seemed impossible<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a><br /><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
to please the people. There was a general
shout of laughter as the two poor fellows toiled
along, nearly weighed down by the load they were
carrying; but that was not enough, for the most insulting
epithets were showered upon them, till worried
and distressed beyond endurance, the Old Man
exclaimed, in despair, &ldquo;I see there is no doing right,
but as long as we remain together fault will be
found, so we must part, my old friend;&rdquo; and as they
just then came to a bridge, with his son&rsquo;s help, he
threw the donkey over the side into the river below.</p>

<p class="stl1">Doctor Dobbs, and his Horse Nobbs.</p>


<div class="figleft">
<img src="images/ill-d.jpg" width="70" height="76" alt="D" title="D" />
</div>

<p class="cap"><span class="upper">Doctor</span> Daniel Dobbs, of Doncaster, had
a nag that was called Nobbs. One day,
in the middle of winter, the Doctor having
been summoned to attend a patient at
some distance from his dwelling, and being anxious
to return home before it was dark, rode poor Nobbs
very hard. On his arrival, not finding his man in
the way, the Doctor fastened Nobbs by his bridle to
a rail in the yard, and went into his parlour, where
he sat down to warm himself by a good fire. It had
happened that the Doctor&rsquo;s dairy-maid had brewed
a barrel of strong beer, which had been drawn off
into the cooler; and the dairy-maid having been
called away to milk her cows, she had carelessly
left the door of the brewhouse open. The steam of
the beer proved wonderfully inviting to poor Nobbs,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
who had been hard rode, and now stood in the cold
extremely thirsty. After sundry efforts he got loose
from the rail, and repairing to the brewhouse, drank
so heartily of the beer, that, before he was aware of
it, he fell down dead drunk. The Doctor&rsquo;s man
coming home, ran into the yard to convey Nobbs to
the stable; not finding him at the rail, he looked
about, and at length discovered him stretched upon
the ground, cold and insensible. Bursting into the
parlour, where the Doctor was seated with Mrs.
Dobbs, he communicated to them the news of poor
Nobby&rsquo;s decease. The Doctor and Mrs. Dobbs were
both good-natured people, and of course were much
concerned; but as the Doctor never suffered misfortunes
to get the better of his discretion, he immediately
gave orders that Nobbs should without delay
be flayed, and that his skin should be taken next
morning to the currier.</p>

<p>The Doctor&rsquo;s man accordingly set to work: poor
Nobbs was dragged to the dunghill, his skin was
stripped off, and he was left to be eaten by the
hounds. He had not, however, lain long before the
novelty of his situation had a considerable effect<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a><br /><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
upon him. As he had lost his skin, of course the
coldness of the night operated with double activity
in dissipating the fumes of the beer which he had
swallowed; and at length he awoke, got upon his
legs, and trotted away to the stable-door, which happened
to be close by the parlour. Not finding it
open, and being both cold and hungry, he began to
whinny for assistance. The Doctor and his wife
had just done supper, and happened at that moment
to be talking of the accident which had befallen their
nag, over a hot bowl of brandy-punch. No sooner
had Nobbs whinnied, than Mrs. Dobbs turned pale,
and exclaimed, &ldquo;Doctor Dobbs! as sure as I live,
that is Nobb&rsquo;s voice&mdash;I know him by his whinny!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My Dear,&rdquo; said the Doctor, &ldquo;it is Nobb&rsquo;s
whinny sure enough; but, poor thing, he is dead,
and has been flayed.&rdquo; He had hardly said this before
Nobbs whinnied again&mdash;up jumps the Doctor,
takes a candle in his hand, and runs into the yard.
The first thing he saw was Nobbs himself without
his skin. The Doctor summoned all his servants,
ordered six sheep to be killed, and clapped their
skins upon poor Nobbs. To make a long story<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
short, Nobbs recovered, and did his work as well as
ever. The sheep-skin stuck fast, and answered his
purpose as well as his own skin ever did. But what
is most remarkable, the wool grew rapidly; and
when the shearing season came, the Doctor had
Nobbs sheared. Every year he gave the Doctor a
noble fleece, for he carried upon his back, you
know, as much as six sheep; and as long as Nobbs
lived, all the Doctor&rsquo;s stockings, and all Mrs. Dobbs&rsquo;
flannel petticoats, were made of his wool.</p>

<p class="stl1">The Brownie.</p>


<div class="figleft">
<img src="images/ill-t3.jpg" width="71" height="76" alt="T" title="T" />
</div>

<p class="cap"><span class="upper">There</span> was once a farmer whose name was
John Burdon, a kindly, industrious man,
who lived happily with his wife and children,
in an old house, where his father
had lived before him.</p>

<p>His five children were thriving and merry, with
no more quarrelling than is usual amongst children,
and altogether there was a quiet in the old house,
in spite of the games that were going on within.
Of a sudden all this changed, and every thing seemed
to go wrong.</p>

<p>Whatever the game might be, one of the children
was sure to be hurt. If they were playing at ball,
the ball would be sure to strike one or the other on
the nose or in the eye, on which a bellowing followed;
or if the game was puss-in-the-corner, or
blind-man&rsquo;s-buff, two or more of the children were
certain to run their heads together, or tear their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a><br /><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
clothes, so that the good dame, whose boast it had
always been that they never got into mischief, had
now enough to do to repair the daily damage.</p>

<p>The farmer, now hearing constant complaints,
said some evil spirit must have crept into the house;
and he was right enough.</p>

<p>A brownie or goblin had taken up his abode there,
and not finding the quiet within which the outside
promised, bestowed his ill-humour upon the inmates,
and daily invented some new scheme for tormenting
the children.</p>

<p>In one corner of the kitchen in which they generally
played there was a closet, where the brownie
had located himself; and that he might watch them,
and see at what moment he could best torment
them, he had thrust out a knot that was in the
closet door, thus making himself a little window.</p>

<p>Now, it happened one day that the eldest boy
had the shoe-horn in his hand, and merely in play
stuck it in the knot-hole, whence it was immediately
ejected, striking the boy on the head.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/ill47.jpg" width="390" height="520" alt="" />
<br /><span class="caption">The Brownie&rsquo;s revengeful Pranks.</span>
</div>

<p>As often as this was repeated so often it darted
out, such good aim being taken that it invariably<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
struck one of them on the head, and generally the
one who had put it there.</p>

<p>Though one always suffered, it was sport to the
others, and therefore the horn was frequently stuck
in the hole, so that the brownie became more and
more irritated, not confining his pranks to the children,
but making the parents suffer in various ways.</p>

<p>There would be noises in the night, and things
that were in daily use would all at once be mislaid,
and, after ever so much trouble and worry, found in
places where they had already been a dozen times
looked for. There could be no doubt this was the
brownie&rsquo;s doing, and there could be still less doubt
when the chair was moved back, just at the moment
when one of the old couple was going to sit down,
and he or she went rolling on the floor, for then a
laugh was heard proceeding from the moved chair.</p>

<p>This trick was played them more particularly
when they had anything in their hands, such as a
cup of tea, which would be emptied in the falling
one&rsquo;s face, and the laughing on such occasions was
louder and longer.</p>

<p>At length, unable to bear it, the farmer determined<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
to leave a house where there was no longer
any comfort, and, if possible, to let it.</p>

<p>The last load of the furniture was being removed,
and the Farmer, following with his wife, said&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m heavy at heart at leaving the old house,
where, for years, we were so happy, and perhaps we
shall not find the new one half as convenient.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The new one will not be half as convenient,&rdquo;
was uttered in a strange, squeaky voice, which
seemed to be in an old tub at the back of the cart.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh! oh! are you there?&rdquo; cried the poor Farmer,
&ldquo;then we may as well turn back.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes! turn back,&rdquo; said the squeaky voice.</p>

<p>They did, in fact, turn back, and from that day
peace was restored to the house, for the brownie no
longer tormented any of its inmates, nor, indeed, gave
any signs of being there, excepting by immediately
darting the shoe-horn out whenever it was put in
the knot-hole.</p>
